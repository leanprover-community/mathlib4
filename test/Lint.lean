# Testing the `longFile` linter

Things to note:
* `set_option linter.style.longFile 0` disables the linter, allowing us to set a value smaller than
  `1500` without triggering the warning for setting a small value for the option;
* `guard_msgs ... in #exit` and `set_option ... in #exit` allow processing of the file *beyond*
  `#exit`, since they wrap `#exit` inside an anonymous section,
  making Lean active again *after* that anonymous section.
