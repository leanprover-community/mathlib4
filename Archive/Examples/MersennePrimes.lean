# Explicit Mersenne primes

We run some Lucas-Lehmer tests to prove the first Mersenne primes are prime.

See the discussion at the end of [Mathlib/NumberTheory/LucasLehmer.lean]
for ideas about extending this to larger Mersenne primes.

`mersenne 9689` seems to be system dependent:
locally it works fine, but in CI it fails with `(kernel) deep recursion detected`
