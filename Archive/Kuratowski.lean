# The Kuratowski closure-complement theorem

This file proves Kuratowski's closure-complement theorem, which says that if one repeatedly
applies the closure and complement operators to a set in a topological space, at most 14
distinct sets can be obtained.

In another file it will be shown that the maximum can be realized in the real numbers.
(A set realizing the maximum is called a 14-set.)

## Main definitions

* `Topology.ClosureCompl.IsObtainable` is the binary inductive predicate saying that a set can be
  obtained from another using the closure and complement operations.

* `Topology.ClosureCompl.theFourteen` is an explicit multiset of fourteen sets obtained from a
  given set using the closure and complement operations.

## Main results

* `Topology.ClosureCompl.mem_theFourteen_iff_isObtainable`:
  a set `t` is obtainable by from `s` if and only if they are in the Multiset `theFourteen s`.

* `Topology.ClosureCompl.ncard_isObtainable_le_fourteen`:
  for an arbitrary set `s`, there are at most 14 distinct sets that can be obtained from `s` using
  the closure and complement operations (the **Kuratowski closure-complement theorem**).

## Notations

* `k`: the closure of a set.
* `i`: the interior of a set.
* `c`: the complement of a set in docstrings; `ᶜ` is used in the code.
