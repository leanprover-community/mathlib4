# IMO 1998 Q2
In a competition, there are `a` contestants and `b` judges, where `b ≥ 3` is an odd integer. Each
judge rates each contestant as either "pass" or "fail". Suppose `k` is a number such that, for any
two judges, their ratings coincide for at most `k` contestants. Prove that `k / a ≥ (b - 1) / (2b)`.

## Solution
The problem asks us to think about triples consisting of a contestant and two judges whose ratings
agree for that contestant. We thus consider the subset `A ⊆ C × JJ` of all such incidences of
agreement, where `C` and `J` are the sets of contestants and judges, and `JJ = J × J - {(j, j)}`. We
have natural maps: `left : A → C` and `right: A → JJ`. We count the elements of `A` in two ways: as
the sum of the cardinalities of the fibres of `left` and as the sum of the cardinalities of the
fibres of `right`. We obtain an upper bound on the cardinality of `A` from the count for `right`,
and a lower bound from the count for `left`. These two bounds combine to the required result.

First consider the map `right : A → JJ`. Since the size of any fibre over a point in JJ is bounded
by `k` and since `|JJ| = b^2 - b`, we obtain the upper bound: `|A| ≤ k(b^2-b)`.

Now consider the map `left : A → C`. The fibre over a given contestant `c ∈ C` is the set of
ordered pairs of (distinct) judges who agree about `c`. We seek to bound the cardinality of this
fibre from below. Minimum agreement for a contestant occurs when the judges' ratings are split as
evenly as possible. Since `b` is odd, this occurs when they are divided into groups of size
`(b-1)/2` and `(b+1)/2`. This corresponds to a fibre of cardinality `(b-1)^2/2` and so we obtain
the lower bound: `a(b-1)^2/2 ≤ |A|`.

Rearranging gives the result.
