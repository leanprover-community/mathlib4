# IMO 1972 Q5

Problem: `f` and `g` are real-valued functions defined on the real line. For all `x` and `y`,
`f(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2f(x)g(y)`. `f` is not identically zero and `|f(x)| ≤ 1` for all `x`.
Prove that `|g(x)| ≤ 1` for all `x`.

This proof begins by introducing the supremum of `f`, `k ≤ 1` as well as `k' = k / ‖g y‖`. We then
suppose that the conclusion does not hold (`hneg`) and show that `k ≤ k'` (by
`2 * (‖f x‖ * ‖g y‖) ≤ 2 * k` obtained from the main hypothesis `hf1`) and that `k' < k` (obtained
from `hneg` directly), finally raising a contradiction with `k' < k'`.
