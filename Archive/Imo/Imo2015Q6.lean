# IMO 2015 Q6

The sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots$ of integers satisfies the conditions

1. $1 ≤ a_j ≤ 2015$ for all $j ≥ 1$,
2. $k + a_k ≠ l + a_l$ for all $1 ≤ k < l$.

Prove that there exist two positive integers $b$ and $N$ for which
$$\left|\sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j-b)\right| ≤ 1007^2$$
for all integers $m,n$ such that $N ≤ m < n$.

# Solution

We follow solution 2 ("juggling") from https://web.evanchen.cc/exams/IMO-2015-notes.pdf.

Consider a collection of balls at different integer heights that starts out empty at time 0
and is modified at each succeeding integer time `t` as follows:

* If there is a ball at height 0 it is removed (caught)
* Then a ball is added at height $a_t$
* Then all balls have their height decreased by 1

Condition 1 ensures that all heights stay in [0, 2014]. Condition 2 ensures that the heights at any
point in time are distinct, so we can model the collection as a finset of heights of monotonically
increasing, bounded cardinality. So there is a time where the cardinality reaches a maximum;
we take `N` to be that time and `b` to be that maximum cardinality. $1 ≤ b ≤ 2015$.

Let $S_t$ be the sum of heights at time $t$. The key observation is that for all $t ≥ N$
$$S_{t+1} = S_t + a_{t+1} - b$$
because 0 must be in the set of heights at time $t$ (otherwise the cardinality will increase);
this height is replaced by $a_{t+1}$ and then all $b$ balls have their height decreased by 1. Thus
$$\left|\sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j-b)\right| = |S_n - S_m|.$$
Now for all $t ≥ N$,
$$\sum_{i=0}^{b-1} i ≤ S_t ≤ 0 + \sum_{i=0}^{b-2} (2014-i),$$
so the absolute difference is upper-bounded by
$$\sum_{i=0}^{b-2} (2014-i) - (b-1) - \sum_{i=0}^{b-2} (b-2-i) = (b-1)(2015-b) ≤ 1007^2.$$
