# IMO 1962 Q4

Solve the equation `cos x ^ 2 + cos (2 * x) ^ 2 + cos (3 * x) ^ 2 = 1`.

Since Lean does not have a concept of "simplest form", we just express what is
in fact the simplest form of the set of solutions, and then prove it equals the set of solutions.

The key to solving this problem simply is that we can rewrite the equation as
a product of terms, shown in `alt_formula`, being equal to zero.

We now present a second solution.  The key to this solution is that, when the identity is
converted to an identity which is polynomial in `a` := `cos x`, it can be rewritten as a product of
terms, `a ^ 2 * (2 * a ^ 2 - 1) * (4 * a ^ 2 - 3)`, being equal to zero.
