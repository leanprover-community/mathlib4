# Root transport under the splitting-field embedding

The remaining `Ω`-side obligation of the frame bridge (`GMC2.FrameBridge.hS_of_splits`) constructs
the packet `S` as the roots of `Φ` (in the splitting field) that land on the Weierstrass
distinguished factor `P` after embedding into `Ω = AlgebraicClosure (LaurentSeries F)`. The
foundation for that construction is that the embedding `ψ` transports the full root multiset of `Φ`
verbatim: every root in `Ω` is the `ψ`-image of a unique splitting-field root. This holds because
`Φ` already splits in its splitting field, so `Splits.roots_map` applies.

/-- **Root transport.** For any `RatFunc F`-algebra embedding `ψ` of the splitting field of `Φ` into
a field `Ω`, the multiset of roots of `Φ` in `Ω` is the `ψ`-image of the multiset of roots in the
splitting field. (Since `Φ` splits in `SplittingField`, `Splits.roots_map` moves its roots along
`ψ`, and `ψ ∘ algebraMap = algebraMap` identifies the mapped polynomial with `Φ` over `Ω`.) -/
