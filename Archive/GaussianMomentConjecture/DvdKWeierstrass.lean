# Obstacle (ii) of the small-root product identity via Mathlib's Weierstrass preparation

The last gap in the GMC(2)/DvdK proof (the orbit-product argument route) is the small-root product
identity, whose obstacle (ii) is the construction of the **small-root factor** of `Φ = x^M − t·R(x)`
— the degree-`M` distinguished polynomial `P` (`P ≡ x^M mod t`) with `Φ = P · h`, `h` a unit. This
was originally estimated as manual monic-M-th-root Hensel + a `(t)`-adic fixed-point iteration ("the
next substantial piece", months-scale).

**This file shows Mathlib already has it.**  View `Φ` as a power series in `x` over the
complete local ring `A = F[[t]]`; its residue image is `x^M ≠ 0`, so
`PowerSeries.exists_isWeierstrassFactorization` produces exactly the distinguished factor `P`
and the unit `h`.  The only missing instance — `IsAdicComplete (maximalIdeal A) A` — is
assembled from `PowerSeries.maximalIdeal_eq_span_X` plus the `(X)`-adic completeness instance
Mathlib already provides (the same instance used for obstacle (i)).

So obstacle (ii) is **not** months of manual Hensel; it is a direct Mathlib appeal, kernel-pure.

Conventions: `A = PowerSeries F = F[[t]]` (inner variable `t = PowerSeries.X`); `Φ ∈ A⟦X⟧`
is a power series in `x = X` (outer).  `Φ = x^M − t·R(x)` with `R : F[X]` embedded as
`R.map (algebraMap F A)`.

/-- **The multiplicative the small-root product identity crux reduces to a single scalar identity.**
From `Φ = P·h` (Weierstrass), taking the `x`-constant term gives
`P.coeff 0 · h(0) = −t·r₀`, where `h(0) := constantCoeff h` is a unit of `F[[t]]` (`= 1 mod t`).
Hence the small-root product `Π = (−1)^M·P.coeff 0` satisfies `Π · h(0) = c·t` with
`c = (−1)^{M+1} r₀`, so **`Π = c·t ⟺ h(0,t) = 1`**.  This isolates the sole remaining analytic
input as exactly `h(0,t) = 1` under `D_m = 0` (equivalently `h(0,t) = exp(−∑ D_m tᵐ/m)`). -/
