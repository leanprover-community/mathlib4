# Decision procedure: necessary condition

We introduce a condition `Decstr` and show that if a string `en` is `Derivable`, then `Decstr en`
holds.

Using this, we give a negative answer to the question: is `"MU"` derivable?

### Numerical condition on the `I` count

Suppose `st : Miustr`. Then `count I st` is the number of `I`s in `st`. We'll show, if
`Derivable st`, then `count I st` must be 1 or 2 modulo 3. To do this, it suffices to show that if
the `en : Miustr` is derived from `st`, then `count I en` moudulo 3 is either equal to or is twice
`count I st`, modulo 3.
-/


/-- Given `st en : Miustr`, the relation `CountEquivOrEquivTwoMulMod3 st en` holds if `st` and
`en` either have equal `count I`, modulo 3, or `count I en` is twice `count I st`, modulo 3.

### Condition on `M`

That solves the MU puzzle, but we'll proceed by demonstrating the other necessary condition for a
string to be derivable, namely that the string must start with an M and contain no M in its tail.

`Goodm st` holds, then so does `Goodm en`.

derivable.

`Decstr en` is the condition that `count I en` is 1 or 2 modulo 3, that `en` starts with `M`, and
that `en` has no `M` in its tail. We automatically derive that this is a decidable predicate.
