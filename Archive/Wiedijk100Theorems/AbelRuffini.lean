# Construction of an algebraic number that is not solvable by radicals.

This file shows that the roots of `X ^ 5 - X - 1` are not solvable by radicals.

The main ingredients are:
* `solvableByRad.isSolvable'` in `Mathlib/FieldTheory/AbelRuffini.lean` :
  an irreducible polynomial with an `IsSolvableByRad` root has solvable Galois group
 * `Polynomial.X_pow_sub_X_sub_one_irreducible_rat` and `Polynomial.X_pow_sub_X_sub_one_gal` in
  `RingTheory/Polynomial/Selmer.lean`: `X ^ 5 - X - 1` is irreducible and has full Galois group
 * `Equiv.Perm.not_solvable` in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Solvable.lean` : the symmetric group is not
  solvable
