# This file tracks the formalisation status of theorems from the experimental
# 1000+ theorems project (https://1000-plus.github.io/).
# This file and associated infrastructure are work in progress.
#
# Current TODOs/unresolved questions:
# - should this file include further metadata, such as repository links, author names or dates?
# - add infrastructure for updating the information upstream when formalisations are added
# - perhaps add a wikidata version of the stacks tag, and generate this file automatically
#   (can this handle formalisation of *statements* also?)
# - complete the information which theorems are already formalised
