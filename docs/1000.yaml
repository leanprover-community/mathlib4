# This file tracks the formalisation status of theorems from the experimental
# 1000+ theorems project (https://1000-plus.github.io/).
# This file and associated infrastructure are work in progress.
#
# See yaml_check.py for documentation about the allowed fields in this file.
# Note that the field names in this file should match the specification of the
# upstream project, hence should not be changed without due consideration.
# The structure of this file is checked by `scripts/yaml_check.py` in this repo

# Current TODOs/unresolved questions:
# - perhaps add a wikidata version of the stacks attribute, and generate this file automatically
