This is the work in progress port of [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib) to [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/).

# Contributing
A guide on how to port a file from mathlib3 to mathlib4 can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki).
The porting effort is coordinated through [zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/),
if you want to contribute to the port please come to the `mathlib4` stream.

# Build instructions

* Make sure Lean is not running, and close all instances of VSCode running Lean processes.
* Get the newest version of `elan`. If you already have installed a version of Lean, you can run
  ```
  elan self update
  ```
  If the above command fails, or if you need to install `elan`, run
  ```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
  ```
  If this also fails, follow the instructions under `Regular install` [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
* To build `mathlib4` run `lake build`. To build and run all tests, run `make`.
* You can use `lake build +Mathlib.Import.Path` to build a particular file, e.g. `lake build +Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Defs`.
* If you added a new file, run the following command to update `Mathlib.lean`
  ```
  find Mathlib -name "*.lean" | env LC_ALL=C sort | sed 's/\.lean//;s,/,.,g;s/^/import /' > Mathlib.lean
  ```

## Building HTML documentation
Building HTML documentation locally is straightforward:
```
lake -Kdoc=on build Mathlib:docs
```
The HTML files can then be found in `build/doc`.

## Dependencies
If you want to update dependencies, use `lake update -Kdoc=on`.
This will update the `lean_packages/manifest.json` file correctly.
You will need to make a PR after committing the changes to this file.
