[Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io) is a user maintained library for the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io).
It contains both programming infrastructure and mathematics,
as well as tactics that use the former and allow to develop the latter.

## Installation

You can find detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools on [our website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
Alternatively, click on one of the buttons below to open a GitHub Codespace or a Gitpod workspace containing the project.

## Using `mathlib4` as a dependency

Please refer to
[https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency)

## Experimenting

Got everything installed? Why not start with the [tutorial project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)?

For more pointers, see [Learning Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html).

## Documentation

Besides the installation guides above and [Lean's general
documentation](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/), the documentation
of mathlib consists of:

- [The mathlib4 docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/index.html): documentation [generated
  automatically](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4) from the source `.lean` files.
- A description of [currently covered theories](https://leanprover-community.github.io/theories.html),
  as well as an [overview](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html) for mathematicians.
- Some [extra Lean documentation](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html) not specific to mathlib (see "Miscellaneous topics")
- Documentation for people who would like to [contribute to mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html)

Much of the discussion surrounding mathlib occurs in a [Zulip chat
room](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/), and you are welcome to join, or read
along without signing up.  Questions from users at all levels of expertise are
welcome!  We also provide an [archive of the public
discussions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/), which is useful
for quick reference.

## Contributing

The complete documentation for contributing to ``mathlib`` is located
[on the community guide contribute to mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html)

You may want to subscribe to the `mathlib4` channel on [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) to introduce yourself and your plan to the community.
Often you can find community members willing to help you get started and advise you on the fit and
feasibility of your project.

* To obtain precompiled `olean` files, run `lake exe cache get`. (Skipping this step means the next step will be very slow.)
* To build `mathlib4` run `lake build`.
* To build and run all tests, run `lake test`.
* You can use `lake build Mathlib.Import.Path` to build a particular file, e.g. `lake build Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Defs`.
* If you added a new file, run the following command to update `Mathlib.lean`

  ```shell
  lake exe mk_all
  ```

### Guidelines

Mathlib has the following guidelines and conventions that must be followed

 - The [style guide](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html)
 - A guide on the [naming convention](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)
 - The [documentation style](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/doc.html)

### Downloading cached build files

You can run `lake exe cache get` to download cached build files that are computed by `mathlib4`'s automated workflow.

If something goes mysteriously wrong,
you can try one of `lake clean` or `rm -rf .lake` before trying `lake exe cache get` again.
In some circumstances you might try `lake exe cache get!`
which re-downloads cached build files even if they are available locally.

Call `lake exe cache` to see its help menu.

### Building HTML documentation

The [mathlib4_docs repository](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4_docs)
is responsible for generating and publishing the
[mathlib4 docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/index.html).

That repo can be used to build the docs locally:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4_docs.git
cd mathlib4_docs
cp ../mathlib4/lean-toolchain .
lake exe cache get
lake build Mathlib:docs
```
The last step may take a while (>20 minutes).
The HTML files can then be found in `.lake/build/doc`.

## Transitioning from Lean 3

For users familiar with Lean 3 who want to get up to speed in Lean 4 and migrate their existing
Lean 3 code we have:

- A [survival guide](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Lean-4-survival-guide-for-Lean-3-users)
  for Lean 3 users
- [Instructions to run `mathport`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathport#running-on-a-project-other-than-mathlib)
  on a project other than mathlib. `mathport` is the tool the community used to port the entirety
  of `mathlib` from Lean 3 to Lean 4.

### Dependencies

If you are a mathlib contributor and want to update dependencies, use `lake update`,
or `lake update batteries aesop` (or similar) to update a subset of the dependencies.
This will update the `lake-manifest.json` file correctly.
You will need to make a PR after committing the changes to this file.

Please do not run `lake update -Kdoc=on` as previously advised, as the documentation related
dependencies should only be included when CI is building documentation.
