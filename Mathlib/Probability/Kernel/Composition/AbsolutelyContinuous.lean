# Absolute continuity of the composition of measures and kernels

This file contains some results about the absolute continuity of the composition of measures and
kernels which use an assumption `CountableOrCountablyGenerated α β` on the measurable spaces.

Results that hold without that assumption are in files about the definitions of compositions and
products, like `Mathlib/Probability/Kernel/Composition/MeasureCompProd.lean` and
`Mathlib/Probability/Kernel/Composition/MeasureComp.lean`.

The assumption ensures the measurability of the sets where two kernels are absolutely continuous
or mutually singular.

## Main statements

* `absolutelyContinuous_compProd_iff'`: `μ ⊗ₘ κ ≪ ν ⊗ₘ η ↔ μ ≪ ν ∧ ∀ᵐ a ∂μ, κ a ≪ η a`.
