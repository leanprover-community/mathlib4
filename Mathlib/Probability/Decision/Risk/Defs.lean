# Risk of an estimator

An estimation problem is defined by a parameter space `Θ`, a data generating kernel `P : Kernel Θ 𝓧`
and a loss function `ℓ : Θ → 𝓨 → ℝ≥0∞`.
A (randomized) estimator is a kernel `κ : Kernel 𝓧 𝓨` that maps data to estimates of a quantity
of interest that depends on the parameter. Often the quantity of interest is the parameter itself
and `𝓨 = Θ`.
The quality of an estimate `y` when data comes from the distribution with parameter `θ` is measured
by the value of the loss function `ℓ θ y`.

## Main definitions

The risk is the average loss of the estimator `κ` on data generated by `P` with parameter `θ`,
equal to `∫⁻ y, ℓ θ y ∂((κ ∘ₖ P) θ)`. We don't introduce a new definition for that risk.

* `bayesianRisk ℓ P κ π`: average of the risk with respect to the prior `π : Measure Θ`.
* `bayesRiskPrior ℓ P π`: minimum of the Bayesian risks over all estimators, that is over all
  Markov kernels `κ : Kernel 𝓧 𝓨`.
* `bayesRisk ℓ P`: supremum of the Bayes risks over all priors (probability measures on `Θ`).
* `minimaxRisk ℓ P`: infimum over all estimators of the maximum over `θ` of the risk.
