# Links between independence and characteristic function

Two random variables are independent if and only if their joint characteristic function is equal
to the product of the characteristic functions. More specifically, prove this in Hilbert spaces for
two variables and a finite family of variables. We prove the analoguous statemens in Banach spaces,
with an arbitrary Lp norm, for the dual characteristic function.
