# Random variables are independent iff their joint distribution is the product measure.

There are several possible measurability assumptions:
* The map `ω ↦ (Xᵢ(ω))ᵢ` is measurable.
* For all `i`, the map `ω ↦ Xᵢ(ω)` is measurable.
* The map `ω ↦ (Xᵢ(ω))ᵢ` is almost everywhere measurable.
* For all `i`, the map `ω ↦ Xᵢ(ω)` is almost everywhere measurable.
Although the first two options are equivalent, the last two are not if the index set is not
countable. Therefore we first prove the third case `iIndepFun_iff_map_fun_eq_infinitePi_map₀`,
then deduce the fourth case in `iIndepFun_iff_map_fun_eq_infinitePi_map₀'` (assuming the index
type is countable), and we prove the first case in `iIndepFun_iff_map_fun_eq_infinitePi_map`.
