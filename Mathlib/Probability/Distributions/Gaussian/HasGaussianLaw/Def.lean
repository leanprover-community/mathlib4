# Gaussian random variables

In this file we define a predicate `HasGaussianLaw X P`, which states that under the probability
measure `P`, the random variable `X` has a Gaussian distribution, i.e. `IsGaussian (P.map X)`.

## Main definition

* `HasGaussianLaw X P`: The random variable `X` has a Gaussian distribution under the measure `P`.
