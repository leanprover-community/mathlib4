/-! # Notations for probability theory

This file defines the following notations, for functions `X,Y`, measures `P, Q` defined on a
measurable space `m0`, and another measurable space structure `m` with `hm : m ≤ m0`,
- `P[X] = ∫ a, X a ∂P`
- `𝔼[X] = ∫ a, X a`
- `𝔼[X|m]`: conditional expectation of `X` with respect to the measure `volume` and the
  measurable space `m`. The similar `P[X|m]` for a measure `P` is defined in
  `MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.Basic`.
- `P⟦s|m⟧ = P[s.indicator (fun ω => (1 : ℝ)) | m]`, conditional probability of a set.
- `X =ₐₛ Y`: `X =ᵐ[volume] Y`
- `X ≤ₐₛ Y`: `X ≤ᵐ[volume] Y`
- `∂P/∂Q = P.rnDeriv Q`
We note that the notation `∂P/∂Q` applies to three different cases, namely,
`MeasureTheory.Measure.rnDeriv`, `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.rnDeriv` and
`MeasureTheory.ComplexMeasure.rnDeriv`.

- `ℙ` is a notation for `volume` on a measured space.
