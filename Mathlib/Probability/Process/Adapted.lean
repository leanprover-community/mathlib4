# Adapted and progressively measurable processes

This file defines some standard definition from the theory of stochastic processes including
filtrations and stopping times. These definitions are used to model the amount of information
at a specific time and are the first step in formalizing stochastic processes.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Adapted`: a sequence of functions `u` is said to be adapted to a
  filtration `f` if at each point in time `i`, `u i` is `f i`-strongly measurable
* `MeasureTheory.ProgMeasurable`: a sequence of functions `u` is said to be progressively
  measurable with respect to a filtration `f` if at each point in time `i`, `u` restricted to
  `Set.Iic i × Ω` is strongly measurable with respect to the product `MeasurableSpace` structure
  where the σ-algebra used for `Ω` is `f i`.

## Main results

* `Adapted.progMeasurable_of_continuous`: a continuous adapted process is progressively measurable.
