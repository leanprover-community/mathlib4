import Mathlib.Tactic.PPWithUniv

/-! # `ToLevel` class

This module defines `Lean.ToLevel`, which is the `Lean.Level` analogue to `Lean.ToExpr`.

**Warning:** Import `Mathlib/Tactic/ToExpr.lean` instead of this one if you are writing `ToExpr`
instances. This ensures that you are using the universe polymorphic `ToExpr` instances that
override the ones from Lean 4 core.
