Close the goal `g` using `Eq.mp v e`,
where `v` is a metavariable asserting that the type of `g` and `e` are equal.
Then call `MVarId.congrN!` (also using local hypotheses and reflexivity) on `v`,
and return the resulting goals.

With `sym = true`, reverses the equality in `v`, and uses `Eq.mpr v e` instead.
With `depth = some n`, calls `MVarId.congrN! n` instead, with `n` as the max recursion depth.

The `exact e` and `refine e` tactics require a term `e` whose type is
definitionally equal to the goal. `convert e` is similar to `refine e`,
but the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the
goal. Instead, new goals are created for differences between the type
of `e` and the goal using the same strategies as the `congr!` tactic.
For example, in the proof state

```lean
n : ℕ,
e : Prime (2 * n + 1)
⊢ Prime (n + n + 1)
```

the tactic `convert e using 2` will change the goal to

```lean
⊢ n + n = 2 * n
```

In this example, the new goal can be solved using `ring`.

The `using 2` indicates it should iterate the congruence algorithm up to two times,
where `convert e` would use an unrestricted number of iterations and lead to two
impossible goals: `⊢ HAdd.hAdd = HMul.hMul` and `⊢ n = 2`.

A variant configuration is `convert (config := .unfoldSameFun) e`, which only equates function
applications for the same function (while doing so at the higher `default` transparency).
This gives the same goal of `⊢ n + n = 2 * n` without needing `using 2`.

The `convert` tactic applies congruence lemmas eagerly before reducing,
therefore it can fail in cases where `exact` succeeds:
```lean
def p (n : ℕ) := True
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by exact h -- succeeds
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by convert h -- fails, with leftover goal `1 = 0`
```
Limiting the depth of recursion can help with this. For example, `convert h using 1` will work
in this case.

The syntax `convert ← e` will reverse the direction of the new goals
(producing `⊢ 2 * n = n + n` in this example).

Internally, `convert e` works by creating a new goal asserting that
the goal equals the type of `e`, then simplifying it using
`congr!`. The syntax `convert e using n` can be used to control the
depth of matching (like `congr! n`). In the example, `convert e using 1`
would produce a new goal `⊢ n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`.

Refer to the `congr!` tactic to understand the congruence operations. One of its many
features is that if `x y : t` and an instance `Subsingleton t` is in scope,
then any goals of the form `x = y` are solved automatically.

Like `congr!`, `convert` takes an optional `with` clause of `rintro` patterns,
for example `convert e using n with x y z`.

The `convert` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
convert (config := {transparency := .default}) h
```
These are passed to `congr!`. See `Congr!.Config` for options.

`convert_to g using n` attempts to change the current goal to `g`, but unlike `change`,
it will generate equality proof obligations using `congr! n` to resolve discrepancies.
`convert_to g` defaults to using `congr! 1`.
`convert_to` is similar to `convert`, but `convert_to` takes a type (the desired subgoal) while
`convert` takes a proof term.
That is, `convert_to g using n` is equivalent to `convert (?_ : g) using n`.

The syntax for `convert_to` is the same as for `convert`, and it has variations such as
`convert_to ← g` and `convert_to (config := {transparency := .default}) g`.

`ac_change g using n` is `convert_to g using n` followed by `ac_rfl`. It is useful for
rearranging/reassociating e.g. sums:
```lean
example (a b c d e f g N : ℕ) : (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f) + g ≤ N := by
  ac_change a + d + e + f + c + g + b ≤ _
