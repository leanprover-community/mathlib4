## The `bound` tactic

`bound` is an `aesop` wrapper that proves inequalities by straightforward recursion on structure,
assuming that intermediate terms are nonnegative or positive as needed.  It also has some support
for guessing where it is unclear where to recurse, such as which side of a `min` or `max` to use
as the bound or whether to assume a power is less than or greater than one.

The functionality of `bound` overlaps with `positivity` and `gcongr`, but can jump back and forth
between `0 ≤ x` and `x ≤ y`-type inequalities.  For example, `bound` proves
  `0 ≤ c → b ≤ a → 0 ≤ a * c - b * c`
by turning the goal into `b * c ≤ a * c`, then using `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`.  `bound` also
uses specialized lemmas for goals of the form `1 ≤ x, 1 < x, x ≤ 1, x < 1`.

Additional hypotheses can be passed as `bound [h0, h1 n, ...]`.  This is equivalent to declaring
them via `have` before calling `bound`.

See `test/Bound.lean` for tests.

### Calc usage

Since `bound` requires the inequality proof to exactly match the structure of the expression, it is
often useful to iterate between `bound` and `rw / simp` using `calc`.  Here is an example:

```
-- Calc example: A weak lower bound for `z ↦ z^2 + c`
lemma le_sqr_add {c z : ℂ} (cz : abs c ≤ abs z) (z3 : 3 ≤ abs z) :
    2 * abs z ≤ abs (z^2 + c) := by
  calc abs (z^2 + c)
    _ ≥ abs (z^2) - abs c := by bound
    _ ≥ abs (z^2) - abs z := by bound
    _ ≥ (abs z - 1) * abs z := by rw [mul_comm, mul_sub_one, ← pow_two, ← abs.map_pow]
    _ ≥ 2 * abs z := by bound
```

### Aesop rules

`bound` uses threes types of aesop rules: `apply`, `forward`, and closing `tactic`s.  To register a
lemma as an `apply` rule, tag it with `@[bound]`.  It will be automatically converted into either a
`norm apply` or `safe apply` rule depending on the number and type of its hypotheses:

1. Nonnegativity/positivity/nonpositivity/negativity hypotheses get score 1 (those involving `0`).
2. Other inequalities get score 10.
3. Disjunctions `a ∨ b` get score 100, plus the score of `a` and `b`.

Score `0` lemmas turn into `norm apply` rules, and score `0 < s` lemmas turn into `safe apply s`
rules.  The score is roughly lexicographic ordering on the counts of the three type (guessing,
general, involving-zero), and tries to minimize the complexity of hypotheses we have to prove.
See `Mathlib.Tactic.Bound.Attribute` for the full algorithm.

To register a lemma as a `forward` rule, tag it with `@[bound_forward]`.  The most important
builtin forward rule is `le_of_lt`, so that strict inequalities can be used to prove weak
inequalities.  Another example is `HasFPowerSeriesOnBall.r_pos`, so that `bound` knows that any
power series present in the context have positive radius of convergence.  Custom `@[bound_forward]`
rules that similarly expose inequalities inside structures are often useful.

### Guessing apply rules

There are several cases where there are two standard ways to recurse down an inequality, and it is
not obvious which is correct without more information.  For example, `a ≤ min b c` is registered as
a `safe apply 4` rule, since we always need to prove `a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c`.  But if we see `min a b ≤ c`,
either `a ≤ c` or `b ≤ c` suffices, and we don't know which.

In these cases we declare a new lemma with an `∨` hypotheses that covers the two cases.  Tagging
it as `@[bound]` will add a +100 penalty to the score, so that it will be used only if necessary.
Aesop will then try both ways by splitting on the resulting `∨` hypothesis.

Currently the two types of guessing rules are
1. `min` and `max` rules, for both `≤` and `<`
2. `pow` and `rpow` monotonicity rules which branch on `1 ≤ a` or `a ≤ 1`.

### Closing tactics

We close numerical goals with `norm_num` and `linarith`.

### Apply rules for `bound`

Most `bound` lemmas are registered in-place where the lemma is declared. These are only the lemmas

An example use case is

```
-- Calc example: A weak lower bound for `z ↦ z^2 + c`
lemma le_sqr_add {c z : ℂ} (cz : abs c ≤ abs z) (z3 : 3 ≤ abs z) :
    2 * abs z ≤ abs (z^2 + c) := by
  calc abs (z^2 + c)
    _ ≥ abs (z^2) - abs c := by bound
    _ ≥ abs (z^2) - abs z := by bound
    _ ≥ (abs z - 1) * abs z := by rw [mul_comm, mul_sub_one, ← pow_two, ← abs.map_pow]
    _ ≥ 2 * abs z := by bound
```

`bound` is built on top of `aesop`, and uses
1. Apply lemmas registered via the `@[bound]` attribute
2. Forward lemmas registered via the `@[bound_forward]` attribute
3. Local hypotheses from the context
4. Optionally: additional hypotheses provided as `bound [h₀, h₁]` or similar. These are added to the
   context as if by `have := hᵢ`.

The functionality of `bound` overlaps with `positivity` and `gcongr`, but can jump back and forth
between `0 ≤ x` and `x ≤ y`-type inequalities.  For example, `bound` proves
  `0 ≤ c → b ≤ a → 0 ≤ a * c - b * c`
by turning the goal into `b * c ≤ a * c`, then using `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`.  `bound` also
contains lemmas for goals of the form `1 ≤ x, 1 < x, x ≤ 1, x < 1`.  Conversely, `gcongr` can prove
inequalities for more types of relations, supports all `positivity` functionality, and is likely
faster since it is more specialized (not built atop `aesop`). -/
