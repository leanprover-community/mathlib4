# The `variable?` command

This defines a command like `variable` that automatically adds all missing typeclass
arguments. For example, `variable? [Module R M]` is the same as
`variable [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]`, though if any of these three instance
arguments can be inferred from previous variables then they will be omitted.

An inherent limitation with this command is that variables are recorded in the scope as
*syntax*. This means that `variable?` needs to pretty print the expressions we get
from typeclass synthesis errors, and these might fail to round trip.

/-- The `variable?` command has the same syntax as `variable`, but it will auto-insert
missing instance arguments wherever they are needed.
It does not add variables that can already be deduced from others in the current context.
By default the command checks that variables aren't implied by earlier ones, but it does *not*
check that earlier variables aren't implied by later ones.
Unlike `variable`, the `variable?` command does not support changing variable binder types.

The `variable?` command will give a suggestion to replace itself with a command of the form
`variable? ...binders... => ...binders...`.  The binders after the `=>` are the completed
list of binders. When this `=>` clause is present, the command verifies that the expanded
binders match the post-`=>` binders.  The purpose of this is to help keep code that uses
`variable?` resilient against changes to the typeclass hierarchy, at least in the sense
that this additional information can be used to debug issues that might arise.
One can also replace `variable? ...binders... =>` with `variable`.

The core algorithm is to try elaborating binders one at a time, and whenever there is a
typeclass instance inference failure, it synthesizes binder syntax for it and adds it to
the list of binders and tries again, recursively. There are no guarantees that this
process gives the "correct" list of binders.

Structures tagged with the `variable_alias` attribute can serve as aliases for a collection
of typeclasses. For example, given
```lean
@[variable_alias]
structure VectorSpace (k V : Type*) [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]
```
then `variable? [VectorSpace k V]` is
equivalent to `variable {k V : Type*} [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]`, assuming
that there are no pre-existing instances on `k` and `V`.
Note that this is not a simple replacement: it only adds instances not inferrable
from others in the current scope.

A word of warning: the core algorithm depends on pretty printing, so if terms that appear
in binders do not round trip, this algorithm can fail. That said, it has some support
for quantified binders such as `[∀ i, F i]`. -/
syntax (name := «variable?»)
  "variable?" (ppSpace bracketedBinder)* (" =>" (ppSpace bracketedBinder)*)? : command

/--
Attribute to record aliases for the `variable?` command. Aliases are structures that have no
fields, and additional typeclasses are recorded as *arguments* to the structure.

Example:
```
@[variable_alias]
structure VectorSpace (k V : Type*)
  [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]
```
Then `variable? [VectorSpace k V]` ensures that these three typeclasses are present in
the current scope. Notice that it's looking at the arguments to the `VectorSpace` type
constructor. You should not have any fields in `variable_alias` structures.

Notice that `VectorSpace` is not a class; the `variable?` command allows non-classes with the
`variable_alias` attribute to use instance binders.
