Defines the `use` tactic.

TODO: This does not match the full functionality of `use` from mathlib3.
See failing tests in `test/Use.lean`.

namespace Mathlib.Tactic

/--
`use e₁, e₂, ⋯` applies the tactic `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_⟩` and then tries
to close the goal with `trivial` (which may or may not close it). It's
useful, for example, to advance on existential goals, for which terms as
well as proofs of some claims about them are expected.

Examples:

```lean
example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

example : ∃ x : String × String, x.1 = x.2 := by use ("forty-two", "forty-two")
```

-- TODO extend examples in doc-string once mathlib3 parity is achieved.

  `(tactic|(refine ⟨$es,*, ?_⟩; try trivial))
