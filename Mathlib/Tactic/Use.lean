# The `use` tactic

The `use` and `use!` tactics are for instantiating one-constructor inductive types
just like the `exists` tactic, but they can be a little more flexible.

`use` is the more restrained version for mathlib4, and `use!` is the exuberant version
that more closely matches `use` from mathlib3.

Note: The `use!` tactic is almost exactly the mathlib3 `use` except that it does not try
applying `exists_prop`. See the failing test in `test/Use.lean`.

/--
When the goal `mvarId` is an inductive datatype with a single constructor,
this applies that constructor, then returns metavariables for the non-parameter explicit arguments
along with metavariables for the parameters and implicit arguments.

The first list of returned metavariables correspond to the arguments that `⟨x,y,...⟩` notation uses.
The second list corresponds to everything else: the parameters and implicit arguments.
The third list consists of those implicit arguments that are instance implicits, which one can
try to synthesize. The third list is a sublist of the second list.

Returns metavariables for all arguments whether or not the metavariables are assigned.

/-- Use the `args` to refine the goals `gs` in order, but whenever there is a single
goal remaining then first try applying a single constructor if it's for a single-constructor
inductive type. In `eager` mode, instead we always first try to refine, and if that fails we
always try to apply such a constructor no matter if it's the last goal.

Returns the remaining explicit goals `gs`, any goals `acc` due to `refine`, and a sublist of these
of instance arguments that we should try synthesizing after the loop.
The new set of goals should be `gs ++ acc`. -/

`use e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar to `exists`, but unlike `exists` it is equivalent to applying the tactic
`refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and
then trying to close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable discharger (rather
than just `try trivial`).

Examples:

```lean
example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

example : ∃ x : String × String, x.1 = x.2 := by use ("forty-two", "forty-two")
```

`use! e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar but it applies constructors everywhere rather than just for
goals that correspond to the last argument of a constructor. This gives the effect that
nested constructors are being flattened out, with the supplied values being used along the
leaves and nodes of the tree of constructors.
With `use!` one can feed in each `42` one at a time:

```lean
example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! 42, 42

example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! (42, 42)
```

The second line makes use of the fact that `use!` tries refining with the argument before
applying a constructor. Also note that `use`/`use!` by default uses a tactic
called `use_discharger` to discharge goals, so `use! 42` will close the goal in this example since
`use_discharger` applies `rfl`, which as a consequence solves for the other `Nat` metavariable.

These tactics take an optional discharger to handle remaining explicit `Prop` constructor arguments.
By default it is `use (discharger := try with_reducible use_discharger) e₁, e₂, ⋯`.
To turn off the discharger and keep all goals, use `(discharger := skip)`.
To allow "heavy refls", use `(discharger := try use_discharger)`.
