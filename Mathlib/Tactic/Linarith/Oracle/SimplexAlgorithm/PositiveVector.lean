# `linarith` certificate search as an LP problem

`linarith` certificate search can easily be reduced to the following problem:
given the matrix `A` and the list `strictIndexes`,
find the nonnegative vector `v` such that some of its coordinates from
the `strictIndexes` are positive and `A v = 0`.

The function `findPositiveVector` solves this problem.

# Algorithm sketch

1. We translate the problem stated above to some Linear Programming problem. See `stateLP` for
  details. Let us denote the corresponding matrix `B`.

2. We solve the equation `B x = 0` using Gauss Elimination, splitting the set of variables into
  *free* variables, which can take any value,
  and *basic* variables which are linearly expressed through the free one.
  This gives us an initial tableau for the Simplex Algorithm.
  See `Linarith.SimplexAlgorithm.Gauss.getTableau`.

3. We run the Simplex Algorithm until it finds a solution.
  See the file `SimplexAlgorithm.lean`.

/--
Given matrix `A` and list `strictIndexes` of strict inequalities' indexes, we want to state the
Linear Programming problem which solution would give us a solution for the initial problem (see
`findPositiveVector`).

As an objective function (that we are trying to maximize) we use sum of coordinates from
`strictIndexes`: it suffices to find the nonnegative vector that makes this function positive.

We introduce two auxiliary variables and one constraint:
* The variable `y` is interpreted as "homogenized" `1`. We need it because dealing with a
  homogenized problem is easier, but having some "unit" is necessary.
* To bound the problem we add the constraint `x₁ + ... + xₘ + z = y` introducing new variable `z`.

The objective function also interpreted as an auxiliary variable with constraint
`f = ∑ i ∈ strictIndexes, xᵢ`.

The variable `f` has to always be basic while `y` has to be free. Our Gauss method implementation
greedy collects basic variables moving from left to right. So we place `f` before `x`-s and `y`
after them. We place `z` between `f` and `x` because in this case `z` will be basic and
`Gauss.getTableau` produce tableau with nonnegative last column, meaning that we are starting from
a feasible point.

Finds a nonnegative vector `v`, such that `A v = 0` and some of its coordinates from
`strictCoords`
are positive, in the case such `v` exists. If not, throws the error. The latter prevents
`linarith` from doing useless post-processing.
