# The Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure

The Fourier-Motzkin procedure is a variable elimination method for linear inequalities.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier%E2%80%93Motzkin_elimination>

Given a set of linear inequalities `comps = {tᵢ Rᵢ 0}`,
we aim to eliminate a single variable `a` from the set.
We partition `comps` into `comps_pos`, `comps_neg`, and `comps_zero`,
where `comps_pos` contains the comparisons `tᵢ Rᵢ 0` in which
the coefficient of `a` in `tᵢ` is positive, and similar.

For each pair of comparisons `tᵢ Rᵢ 0 ∈ comps_pos`, `tⱼ Rⱼ 0 ∈ comps_neg`,
we compute coefficients `vᵢ, vⱼ ∈ ℕ` such that `vᵢ*tᵢ + vⱼ*tⱼ` cancels out `a`.
We collect these sums `vᵢ*tᵢ + vⱼ*tⱼ R' 0` in a set `S` and set `comps' = S ∪ comps_zero`,
a new set of comparisons in which `a` has been eliminated.

Theorem: `comps` and `comps'` are equisatisfiable.

We recursively eliminate all variables from the system. If we derive an empty clause `0 < 0`,
we conclude that the original system was unsatisfiable.

### Datatypes

The `CompSource` and `PComp` datatypes are specific to the FM elimination routine;
they are not shared with other components of `linarith`.
-/

/--
`CompSource` tracks the source of a comparison.
The atomic source of a comparison is an assumption, indexed by a natural number.
Two comparisons can be added to produce a new comparison,
and one comparison can be scaled by a natural number to produce a new comparison.
 -/

  | assump : Nat → CompSource
  | add : CompSource → CompSource → CompSource
  | scale : Nat → CompSource → CompSource
deriving Inhabited

/--
Given a `CompSource` `cs`, `cs.flatten` maps an assumption index
to the number of copies of that assumption that appear in the history of `cs`.

For example, suppose `cs` is produced by scaling assumption 2 by 5,
and adding to that the sum of assumptions 1 and 2.
`cs.flatten` maps `1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 6`.

def CompSource.flatten : CompSource → HashMap Nat Nat

  | (CompSource.add c1 c2) =>
      (CompSource.flatten c1).mergeWith (fun _ b b' => b + b') (CompSource.flatten c2)
  | (CompSource.scale n c) => (CompSource.flatten c).mapVal (fun _ v => v * n)

  | (CompSource.add c1 c2) => CompSource.toString c1 ++ " + " ++ CompSource.toString c2
  | (CompSource.scale n c) => ToString.toString n ++ " * " ++ CompSource.toString c

instance : ToFormat CompSource :=
  ⟨fun a => CompSource.toString a⟩

/--
A `PComp` stores a linear comparison `Σ cᵢ*xᵢ R 0`,
along with information about how this comparison was derived.
The original expressions fed into `linarith` are each assigned a unique natural number label.
The *historical set* `PComp.history` stores the labels of expressions
that were used in deriving the current `PComp`.
Variables are also indexed by natural numbers. The sets `PComp.effective`, `PComp.implicit`,
and `PComp.vars` contain variable indices.
* `PComp.vars` contains the variables that appear in any inequality in the historical set.
* `PComp.effective` contains the variables that have been effectively eliminated from `PComp`.
  A variable `n` is said to be *effectively eliminated* in `p : PComp` if the elimination of `n`
  produced at least one of the ancestors of `p` (or `p` itself).
* `PComp.implicit` contains the variables that have been implicitly eliminated from `PComp`.
  A variable `n` is said to be *implicitly eliminated* in `p` if it satisfies the following
  properties:
  - `n` appears in some inequality in the historical set (i.e. in `p.vars`).
  - `n` does not appear in `p.c.vars` (i.e. it has been eliminated).
  - `n` was not effectively eliminated.

We track these sets in order to compute whether the history of a `PComp` is *minimal*.
Checking this directly is expensive, but effective approximations can be defined in terms of these
sets. During the variable elimination process, a `PComp` with non-minimal history can be discarded.
-/

/--
Any comparison whose history is not minimal is redundant,
and need not be included in the new set of comparisons.
`elimedGE : ℕ` is a natural number such that all variables with index ≥ `elimedGE` have been
removed from the system.

This test is an overapproximation to minimality. It gives necessary but not sufficient conditions.
If the history of `c` is minimal, then `c.maybeMinimal` is true,
but `c.maybeMinimal` may also be true for some `c` with non-minimal history.
Thus, if `c.maybeMinimal` is false, `c` is known not to be minimal and must be redundant.
See https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88771-9.50019-2 (Theorem 13).
The condition described there considers only implicitly eliminated variables that have been
officially eliminated from the system. This is not the case for every implicitly eliminated
variable. Consider eliminating `z` from `{x + y + z < 0, x - y - z < 0}`. The result is the set
`{2*x < 0}`; `y` is implicitly but not officially eliminated.

This implementation of Fourier-Motzkin elimination processes variables in decreasing order of
indices. Immediately after a step that eliminates variable `k`, variable `k'` has been eliminated
iff `k' ≥ k`. Thus we can compute the intersection of officially and implicitly eliminated variables
by taking the set of implicitly eliminated variables with indices ≥ `elimedGE`.

/--
`PComp.add c1 c2 elimVar` creates the result of summing the linear comparisons `c1` and `c2`,
during the process of eliminating the variable `elimVar`.
The computation assumes, but does not enforce, that `elimVar` appears in both `c1` and `c2`
and does not appear in the sum.
Computing the sum of the two comparisons is easy; the complicated details lie in tracking the
additional fields of `PComp`.
* The historical set `pcomp.history` of `c1 + c2` is the union of the two historical sets.
* `vars` is the union of `c1.vars` and `c2.vars`.
* The effectively eliminated variables of `c1 + c2` are the union of the two effective sets,
  with `elim_var` inserted.
* The implicitly eliminated variables of `c1 + c2` are those that appear in
  `vars` but not `c.vars` or `effective`.
(Note that the description of the implicitly eliminated variables of `c1 + c2` in the algorithm
described in Section 6 of https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88771-9.50019-2 seems to be wrong:
that says it should be `(c1.implicit.union c2.implicit).sdiff explicit`.
Since the implicitly eliminated sets start off empty for the assumption,
this formula would leave them always empty.)

`PComp.assump c n` creates a `PComp` whose comparison is `c` and whose source is
`CompSource.assump n`, that is, `c` is derived from the `n`th hypothesis.
The history is the singleton set `{n}`.
No variables have been eliminated (effectively or implicitly).

`pelimVar p1 p2` calls `elimVar` on the `Comp` components of `p1` and `p2`.
If this returns `v1` and `v2`, it creates a new `PComp` equal to `v1*p1 + v2*p2`,
and tracks this in the `CompSource`.

The linarith monad extends an exceptional monad with a `LinarithData` state.
An exception produces a contradictory `PComp`.

`splitSetByVarSign a comps` partitions the set `comps` into three parts.
* `pos` contains the elements of `comps` in which `a` has a positive coefficient.
* `neg` contains the elements of `comps` in which `a` has a negative coefficient.
* `notPresent` contains the elements of `comps` in which `a` has coefficient 0.

`elimAllVarsM` eliminates all variables from the linarith state, leaving it with a set of
ground comparisons. If this succeeds without exception, the original `linarith` state is consistent.

`mkLinarithData hyps vars` takes a list of hypotheses and the largest variable present in

`produceCertificate hyps vars` tries to derive a contradiction from the comparisons in `hyps`
by eliminating all variables ≤ `maxVar`.
If successful, it returns a map `coeff : ℕ → ℕ` as a certificate.
This map represents that we can find a contradiction by taking the sum `∑ (coeff i) * hyps[i]`.
