# Strongly Connected Components

This file defines tactics to construct proofs of equivalences between a set of mutually equivalent
propositions. The tactics use implications transitively to find sets of equivalent propositions.

## Implementation notes

The tactics use a strongly connected components algorithm on a graph where propositions are
vertices and edges are proofs that the source implies the target. The strongly connected components
are therefore sets of propositions that are pairwise equivalent to each other.

The resulting strongly connected components are encoded in a disjoint set data structure to
facilitate the construction of equivalence proofs between two arbitrary members of an equivalence
class.

## Possible generalizations

Instead of reasoning about implications and equivalence, we could generalize the machinery to
reason about arbitrary partial orders.

/-- `Closure` implements a disjoint set data structure using path compression
optimization. For the sake of the scc algorithm, it also stores the preorder
numbering of the equivalence graph of the local assumptions.

The `ExprMap` encodes a directed forest by storing for every non-root
node, a reference to its parent and a proof of equivalence between
that node's expression and its parent's expression. Given that data
structure, checking that two nodes belong to the same tree is easy and
fast by repeatedly following the parent references until a root is reached.
If both nodes have the same root, they belong to the same tree, i.e. their
expressions are equivalent. The proof of equivalence can be formed by
composing the proofs along the edges of the paths to the root.

More concretely, if we ignore preorder numbering, the set
`{ {e₀,e₁,e₂,e₃}, {e₄,e₅} }` is represented as:

```
e₀ → ⊥      -- no parent, i.e. e₀ is a root
e₁ → e₀, p₁ -- with p₁ : e₁ ↔ e₀
e₂ → e₁, p₂ -- with p₂ : e₂ ↔ e₁
e₃ → e₀, p₃ -- with p₃ : e₃ ↔ e₀
e₄ → ⊥      -- no parent, i.e. e₄ is a root
e₅ → e₄, p₅ -- with p₅ : e₅ ↔ e₄
```

We can check that `e₂` and `e₃` are equivalent by seeking the root of
the tree of each. The parent of `e₂` is `e₁`, the parent of `e₁` is
`e₀` and `e₀` does not have a parent, and thus, this is the root of its tree.
The parent of `e₃` is `e₀` and it's also the root, the same as for `e₂` and
they are therefore equivalent. We can build a proof of that equivalence by using
transitivity on `p₂`, `p₁` and `p₃.symm` in that order.

Similarly, we can discover that `e₂` and `e₅` aren't equivalent.

/-- Strongly connected component algorithm inspired by Tarjan's and

data structure using path compression. This is a compact

equivalence between any two members of an equivalence class.
