/-! # `congr(...)` congruence quotations

This module defines a term elaborator for generating congruence lemmas
from patterns written using quotation syntax.
One can write `congr($hf $hx)` with `hf : f = f'` and `hx : x = x'` to get `f x = f' x'`.
While in simple cases it might be possible to use `congr_arg` or `congr_fun`,
congruence quotations are more general,
since for example `f` could have implicit arguments, complicated dependent types,
and subsingleton instance arguments such as `Decidable` or `Fintype`.

The implementation strategy is the following:

1. The pattern is elaborated twice, once with each hole replaced by the LHS
   and again with each hole replaced by the RHS. We do not force the hole to
   have any particular type while elaborating, but if the hole has a type
   with an obvious LHS or RHS, then we propagate this information outward.
   We use `Mathlib.Tactic.TermCongr.cHole` with metadata for these replacements
   to hold onto the hole itself.
2. Once the pattern has been elaborated twice,
   we unify them against the respective LHS and RHS of the target type
   if the target has a type with an obvious LHS and RHS.
   This can fill in some metavariables and help typeclass inference make progress.
3. Then we simultaneously walk along the elaborated LHS and RHS expressions
   to generate a congruence.
   When we reach `cHole`s, we make sure they elaborated in a compatible way.
   Each `Expr` type has some logic to come up with a suitable congruence.
   For applications we use a version of `Lean.Meta.mkHCongrWithArity` that tries
   to fill in some of the equality proofs using subsingleton lemmas.

The point of elaborating the expression twice is that we let the elaborator handle
activities like synthesizing instances, etc., specialized to LHS or RHS, without trying
to derive one side from the other.

During development there was a version using `simp` transformations, but there was
no way to inform `simp` about the expected RHS, which could cause `simp` to fail because
it eagerly wants to solve for instance arguments. The current version is able to use the
expected LHS and RHS to fill in arguments before solving for instance arguments.

/--
`congr(expr)` generates an congruence from an expression containing
congruence holes of the form `$h` or `$(h)`.
In these congruence holes, `h : a = b` indicates that, in the generated congruence,
on the left-hand side `a` is substituted for `$h`
and on the right-hand side `b` is substituted for `$h`.

For example, if `h : a = b` then `congr(1 + $h) : 1 + a = 1 + b`.

This is able to make use of the expected type, for example `(congr(_ + $h) : 1 + _ = _)`
with `h : x = y` gives `1 + x = 1 + y`.
The expected type can be an `Iff`, `Eq`, or `HEq`.
If there is no expected type, then it generates an equality.

Note: the process of generating a congruence lemma involves elaborating the pattern
using terms with attached metadata and a reducible wrapper.
We try to avoid doing so, but these terms can leak into the local context through unification.
This can potentially break tactics that are sensitive to metadata or reducible functions.
Please report anything that goes wrong with `congr(...)` lemmas on Zulip.

For debugging, you can set `set_option trace.Elab.congr true`.

/-! ### Congruence holes

This section sets up the way congruence holes are elaborated for `congr(...)` quotations.
The basic problem is that if we have `$h` with `h : x = y`, we need to elaborate it once
as `x` and once as `y`, and in both cases the term needs to remember that it's associated
to `h`.
-/

/-- Key for congruence hole metadata.
For a `Bool` recording whether this hole is for the LHS elaboration. -/
private def congrHoleForLhsKey : Name := decl_name%

/-- Key for congruence hole metadata.
For a `Nat` recording how old this congruence hole is, to prevent reprocessing them
if they leak into the local context. -/
private def congrHoleIndex : Name := decl_name%

/-- For holding onto the hole's value along with the value of either the LHS or RHS of the hole.
These occur wrapped in metadata so that they always appear as function application
with exactly four arguments.

Note that there is no relation between `val` and the proof.
We need to decouple these to support letting the proof's elaboration be deferred until
we know whether we want an iff, eq, or heq, while also allowing it to choose
to elaborate as an iff, eq, or heq.
Later, the congruence generator handles any discrepencies.

/-- A congruence lemma between two expressions.
The proof is generated dynamically, depending on whether the resulting lemma should be
an `Eq` or a `HEq`.
If generating a proof impossible, then the generator can throw an error.
This can be due to either an `Eq` proof being impossible
or due to the lhs/rhs not being defeq to the lhs/rhs of the generated proof,
which can happen for user-supplied congruence holes.

This complexity is to support two features:

1. The user is free to supply Iff, Eq, and HEq lemmas in congurence holes,
   and we're able to transform them into whatever is appropriate for a
   given congruence lemma.
2. If the congrence hole is a metavariable, then we can specialize that
   hole to an Iff, Eq, or HEq depending on what's necessary at that site. -/
