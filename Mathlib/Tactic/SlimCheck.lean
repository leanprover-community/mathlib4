## Finding counterexamples automatically using `slim_check`

A proposition can be tested by writing it out as:

```lean
example (xs : List ℕ) (w : ∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) : ∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5 := by slim_check
-- ===================
-- Found problems!

-- xs := [0, 5]
-- x := 0
-- y := 5
-- -------------------

example (x : ℕ) (h : 2 ∣ x) : x < 100 := by slim_check
-- ===================
-- Found problems!

-- x := 258
-- -------------------

example (α : Type) (xs ys : List α) : xs ++ ys = ys ++ xs := by slim_check
-- ===================
-- Found problems!

-- α := ℤ
-- xs := [-4]
-- ys := [1]
-- -------------------

example : ∀ x ∈ [1,2,3], x < 4 := by slim_check
-- Success
```

In the first example, `slim_check` is called on the following goal:

```lean
xs : List ℕ,
h : ∃ (x : ℕ) (H : x ∈ xs), x < 3
⊢ ∀ (y : ℕ), y ∈ xs → y < 5
```

The local constants are reverted and an instance is found for
`Testable (∀ (xs : List ℕ), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))`.
The `Testable` instance is supported by instances of `Sampleable (List ℕ)`,
`Decidable (x < 3)` and `Decidable (y < 5)`. `slim_check` builds a
`Testable` instance step by step with:

```
- Testable (∀ (xs : List ℕ), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))
                                     -: Sampleable (List xs)
- Testable ((∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))
- Testable (∀ x ∈ xs, x < 3 → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))
- Testable (x < 3 → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))
                                     -: Decidable (x < 3)
- Testable (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5)
                                     -: Decidable (y < 5)
```

`Sampleable (List ℕ)` lets us create random data of type `List ℕ` in a way that
helps find small counter-examples.  Next, the test of the proposition
hinges on `x < 3` and `y < 5` to both be decidable. The
implication between the two could be tested as a whole but it would be
less informative. Indeed, if we generate lists that only contain numbers
greater than `3`, the implication will always trivially hold but we should
conclude that we haven't found meaningful examples. Instead, when `x < 3`
does not hold, we reject the example (i.e.  we do not count it toward
the 100 required positive examples) and we start over. Therefore, when
`slim_check` prints `Success`, it means that a hundred suitable lists
were found and successfully tested.

If no counter-examples are found, `slim_check` behaves like `admit`.

`slim_check` can also be invoked using `#eval`:

```lean
#eval SlimCheck.Testable.check (∀ (α : Type) (xs ys : List α), xs ++ ys = ys ++ xs)
-- ===================
-- Found problems!

-- α := ℤ
-- xs := [-4]
-- ys := [1]
-- -------------------
```

instances, see `Testing.SlimCheck.Testable`.

`slim_check` considers a proof goal and tries to generate examples
that would contradict the statement.

Let's consider the following proof goal.

```lean
xs : List ℕ,
h : ∃ (x : ℕ) (H : x ∈ xs), x < 3
⊢ ∀ (y : ℕ), y ∈ xs → y < 5
```

The local constants will be reverted and an instance will be found for
`Testable (∀ (xs : List ℕ), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))`.
The `Testable` instance is supported by an instance of `Sampleable (List ℕ)`,
`Decidable (x < 3)` and `Decidable (y < 5)`.

Examples will be created in ascending order of size (more or less)

The first counter-examples found will be printed and will result in an error:

```
===================
Found problems!
xs := [1, 28]
x := 1
y := 28
-------------------
```

If `slim_check` successfully tests 100 examples, it acts like
admit. If it gives up or finds a counter-example, it reports an error.

instances, see `Testing.SlimCheck.Testable`.

Optional arguments given with `slim_check (config : { ... })`
* `numInst` (default 100): number of examples to test properties with
* `maxSize` (default 100): final size argument

Options:
* `set_option trace.slim_check.decoration true`: print the proposition with quantifier annotations
* `set_option trace.slim_check.discarded true`: print the examples discarded because they do not
  satisfy assumptions
* `set_option trace.slim_check.shrink.steps true`: trace the shrinking of counter-example
* `set_option trace.slim_check.shrink.candidates true`: print the lists of candidates considered
  when shrinking each variable
* `set_option trace.slim_check.instance true`: print the instances of `testable` being used to test
  the proposition
* `set_option trace.slim_check.success true`: print the tested samples that satisfy a property

What to do:
1. make sure that the types you are using have `SlimCheck.SampleableExt` instances
   (you can use `#sample my_type` if you are unsure);
2. make sure that the relations and predicates that your proposition use are decidable;
3. make sure that instances of `SlimCheck.Testable` exist that, when combined,
   apply to your decorated proposition:
```
{tgt'}
```

Use `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true` to understand what instances are missing.

Try this:
set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true
#synth SlimCheck.Testable ({tgt'})"
  let e ← mkAppOptM ``Testable.check #[tgt, toExpr cfg, tgt', inst]
  trace[slim_check.decoration] "[testable decoration]\n  {tgt'}"
