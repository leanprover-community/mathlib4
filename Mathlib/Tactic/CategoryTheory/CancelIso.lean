# Simproc for canceling morphisms with their inverses

This module implements the `cancelIso` simproc, which triggers on expressions of the form `f ≫ g`.

If `g` is not a composition itself, it checks whether `f` is inverse to `g`,
by checking if `f` has an `IsIso` instance, and then running `push inv` on `inv f` and on `g`.
If the check succeeds, then `f ≫ g` is rewritten to `𝟙 _`.

If `g` is of the form `h ≫ k`, the procedure instead checks if `f` and `h` are inverses to each
other, and the procedure rewrites `f ≫ g ≫ h` to `h` if that is the case.
This is useful as simp-normal forms in category theory are right-associated.

For instance, the simproc will successfully rewrite expressions such as
`F.map (G.map (inv (H.map (e.hom)))) ≫ F.map (G.map (H.map (e.inv)))` to `𝟙 _`
because `CategoyTheory.Functor.map_inv` is a `@[push ←]` lemma, and
`CategoyTheory.IsIso.Iso.inv_hom` is a `[push]` lemma.

This procedure is mostly intended as a post-procedure: it will work better if `f` and `g`
have already been traversed beforehand.

/-- Given expressions `C x y z f g` assumed to represent
composable morphisms `f : x ⟶ _` and `g : _ ⟶ z` in a category `C`,
check if `g` is equal to the inverse of `f` by
1. first checking the objects match (i.e x = z).
2. Checking that `f` is an isomorphism by synthesizing an `IsIso` instance for it
3. running `push inv` on both `f` and `g`, and checking that the results are equal.

If they are inverse, return an expression `e` of the proof of `inv f = g`. If any of
the tests above fail, return none. -/
