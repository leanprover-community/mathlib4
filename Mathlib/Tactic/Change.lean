# Tactic `change? term`

This tactic is used to suggest a replacement of the goal by a definitionally equal term.
`term` is intended to contain holes which get unified with the main goal and filled in explicitly
in the suggestion.

`term` can also be omitted, in which case `change?` simply suggests `change` with the main goal.
This is helpful after tactics like `dsimp`, which can then be deleted.

/-- `change? term` unifies `term` with the current goal, then suggests explicit `change` syntax
that uses the resulting unified term.

If `term` is not present, `change?` suggests the current goal itself. This is useful after tactics
which transform the goal while maintaining definitional equality, such as `dsimp`; those preceding
tactic calls can then be deleted.
```lean
example : (fun x : Nat => x) 0 = 1 := by
  change? 0 = _  -- `Try this: change 0 = 1`
