# Consume

Introduces a tactic `consume` that consumes type annotations of the form `autoParam` and `optParam`.

Also add a macro that makes constructor behave more like the `where ...` syntax, attempting
to infer the argument from optional or auto parameters, and if this fails consumes the annotations.

them, see `infer_param` to attempt to use them to fill in the goal instead.  -/
