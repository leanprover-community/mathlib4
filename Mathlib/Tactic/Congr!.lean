# The `congr!` tactic

This is a more powerful version of the `congr` tactic that knows about more congruence lemmas and
can apply to more situations. It is similar to the `congr'` tactic from Mathlib 3.

The `congr!` tactic is used by the `convert` and `convert_to` tactics.

See the syntax docstring for more details.

/-- The configuration for the `congr!` tactic. -/
structure Congr!.Config where
  /-- If `closePre := true`, then try to close goals before applying congruence lemmas
  using tactics such as `rfl` and `assumption.  These tactics are applied with the
  transparency level specified by `preTransparency`, which is `.reducible` by default. -/
  closePre : Bool := true
  /-- If `closePost := true`, then try to close goals that remain after no more congruence
  lemmas can be applied, using the same tactics as `closePre`. These tactics are applied
  with current tactic transparency level. -/
  closePost : Bool := true
  /-- The transparency level to use when applying a congruence theorem.
  By default this is `.reducible`, which prevents unfolding of most definitions. -/
  transparency : TransparencyMode := TransparencyMode.reducible
  /-- The transparency level to use when trying to close goals before applying congruence lemmas.
  This includes trying to prove the goal by `rfl` and using the `assumption` tactic.
  By default this is `.reducible`, which prevents unfolding of most definitions. -/
  preTransparency : TransparencyMode := TransparencyMode.reducible
  /-- For passes that synthesize a congruence lemma using one side of the equality,
  we run the pass both for the left-hand side and the right-hand side. If `preferLHS` is `true`
  then we start with the left-hand side.

  This can be used to control which side's definitions are expanded when applying the
  congruence lemma (if `preferLHS = true` then the RHS can be expanded). -/
  preferLHS : Bool := true
  /-- Allow both sides to be partial applications.
  When false, given an equality `f a b = g x y z` this means we never consider
  proving `f a = g x y`.

  In this case, we might still consider `f = g x` if a pass generates a congruence lemma using the
  left-hand side. Use `sameFun := true` to ensure both sides are applications
  of the same function (making it be similar to the `congr` tactic). -/
  partialApp : Bool := true
  /-- Whether to require that both sides of an equality be applications of defeq functions.
  That is, if true, `f a = g x` is only considered if `f` and `g` are defeq (making it be similar
  to the `congr` tactic). -/
  sameFun : Bool := false
  /-- The maximum number of arguments to consider when doing congruence of function applications.
  For example, with `f a b c = g w x y z`, setting `maxArgs := some 2` means it will only consider
  either `f a b = g w x y` and `c = z` or `f a = g w x`, `b = y`, and `c = z`. Setting
  `maxArgs := none` (the default) means no limit.

  When the functions are dependent, `maxArgs` can prevent congruence from working at all.
  In `Fintype.card α = Fintype.card β`, one needs to have `maxArgs` at `2` or higher since
  there is a `Fintype` instance argument that depends on the first.

  When there aren't such dependency issues, setting `maxArgs := some 1` causes `congr!` to
  do congruence on a single argument at a time. This can be used in conjunction with the
  iteration limit to control exactly how many arguments are to be processed by congruence. -/
  maxArgs : Option Nat := none
  /-- For type arguments that are implicit or have forward dependencies, whether or not `congr!`
  should generate equalities even if the types do not look plausibly equal.

  We have a heuristic in the main congruence generator that types
  `α` and `β` are *plausibly equal* according to the following algorithm:

  - If the types are both propositions, they are plausibly equal (`Iff`s are plausible).
  - If the types are from different universes, they are not plausibly equal.
  - Suppose in whnf we have `α = f a₁ ... aₘ` and `β = g b₁ ... bₘ`. If `f` is not definitionally
    equal to `g` or `m ≠ n`, then `α` and `β` are not plausibly equal.
  - If there is some `i` such that `aᵢ` and `bᵢ` are not plausibly equal, then `α` and `β` are
    not plausibly equal.
  - Otherwise, `α` and `β` are plausibly equal.

  The purpose of this is to prevent considering equalities like `ℕ = ℤ` while allowing equalities
  such as `Fin n = Fin m` or `Subtype p = Subtype q` (so long as these are subtypes of the
  same type).

  The way this is implemented is that when the congruence generator is comparing arguments when
  looking at an equality of function applications, it marks a function parameter as "fixed" if the
  provided arguments are types that are not plausibly equal. The effect of this is that congruence
  succeeds only if those arguments are defeq at `transparency` transparency. -/
  typeEqs : Bool := false
  /-- As a last pass, perform eta expansion of both sides of an equality. For example,
  this transforms a bare `HAdd.hAdd` into `fun x y => x + y`. -/
  etaExpand : Bool := false
  /-- Whether to use the congruence generator that is used by `simp` and `congr`. This generator
  is more strict, and it does not respect all configuration settings. It does respect
  `preferLHS`, `partialApp` and `maxArgs` and transparency settings. It acts as if `sameFun := true`
  and it ignores `typeEqs`. -/
  useCongrSimp : Bool := false

does while also similarly preventing `congr!` from considering partial applications or congruences
between different functions being applied. -/

The heuristic is the following:

- If in whnf both `ty1` and `ty2` have the same head and if (recursively) it's reasonable to
  consider an equality between corresponding type arguments, then yes.
- Otherwise, no.

This helps keep congr from going too far and generating hypotheses like `ℝ = ℤ`.

To keep things from going out of control, there is a `maxDepth`. Additionally, if we do the check
with `maxDepth = 0` then the heuristic answers "no". -/

This is like `Lean.MVarId.hcongr?` but (1) looks at both sides when generating the congruence lemma
and (2) inserts additional hypotheses from equalities from previous arguments.

It uses `Lean.Meta.mkRichHCongr` to generate the congruence lemmas.

If the goal is an `Eq`, it uses `eq_of_heq` first.

As a backup strategy, it uses the LHS/RHS method like in `Lean.MVarId.congrSimp?`
(where `Congr!.Config.preferLHS` determines which side to try first). This uses a particular side
of the target, generates the congruence lemma, then tries applying it. This can make progress
with higher transparency settings. To help the unifier, in this mode it assumes both sides have the
exact same function.

Equates pieces of the left-hand side of a goal to corresponding pieces of the right-hand side by
recursively applying congruence lemmas. For example, with `⊢ f as = g bs` we could get
two goals `⊢ f = g` and `⊢ as = bs`.

Syntax:
```
congr!
congr! n
congr! with x y z
congr! n with x y z
```
Here, `n` is a natural number and `x`, `y`, `z` are `rintro` patterns (like `h`, `rfl`, `⟨x, y⟩`,
`_`, `-`, `(h | h)`, etc.).

The `congr!` tactic is similar to `congr` but is more insistent in trying to equate left-hand sides
to right-hand sides of goals. Here is a list of things it can try:

- If `R` in `⊢ R x y` is a reflexive relation, it will convert the goal to `⊢ x = y` if possible.
  The list of reflexive relations is maintained using the `@[refl]` attribute.
  As a special case, `⊢ p ↔ q` is converted to `⊢ p = q` during congruence processing and then
  returned to `⊢ p ↔ q` form at the end.

- If there is a user congruence lemma associated to the goal (for instance, a `@[congr]`-tagged
  lemma applying to `⊢ List.map f xs = List.map g ys`), then it will use that.

- It uses a congruence lemma generator at least as capable as the one used by `congr` and `simp`.
  If there is a subexpression that can be rewritten by `simp`, then `congr!` should be able
  to generate an equality for it.

- It can do congruences of pi types using lemmas like `implies_congr` and `pi_congr`.

- Before applying congruences, it will run the `intros` tactic automatically.
  The introduced variables can be given names using a `with` clause.
  This helps when congruence lemmas provide additional assumptions in hypotheses.

- When there is an equality between functions, so long as at least one is obviously a lambda, we
  apply `funext` or `Function.hfunext`, which allows for congruence of lambda bodies.

- It can try to close goals using a few strategies, including checking
  definitional equality, trying to apply `Subsingleton.elim` or `proof_irrel_heq`, and using the
  `assumption` tactic.

The optional parameter is the depth of the recursive applications.
This is useful when `congr!` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal.
For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`,
`congr!` produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`,
while `congr! 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.

The `congr!` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
congr! (config := {transparency := .default}) 2
```
This overrides the default, which is to apply congruence lemmas at reducible transparency.

The `congr!` tactic is aggressive with equating two sides of everything. There is a predefined
configuration that uses a different strategy:
Try
```lean
congr! (config := .unfoldSameFun)
```
This only allows congruences between functions applications of definitionally equal functions,
and it applies congruence lemmas at default transparency (rather than just reducible).
This is somewhat like `congr`.

See `Congr!.Config` for all options.
