# Interactive unfolding

This file defines the interactive tactic `unfold?`.
It allows you to shift-click on an expression in the goal, and then it suggests rewrites to replace
the expression with an unfolded version.

It can be used on its own, but it can also be used as part of the library rewrite tactic `rw??`,
where these unfoldings are a subset of the suggestions.

For example, if the goal contains `1+1`, then it will suggest rewriting this into one of
- `Nat.add 1 1`
- `2`

Clicking on a suggestion pastes a rewrite into the editor, which will be of the form
- `rw [show 1+1 = Nat.add 1 1 from rfl]`
- `rw [show 1+1 = 2 from rfl]`
It also takes into account the position of the selected expression if it appears in multiple places,
and whether the rewrite is in the goal or a local hypothesis.
The rewrite string is created using `mkRewrite`.

## Reduction rules

The basic idea is to repeatedly apply `unfoldDefinition?` followed by `whnfCore`, which gives
the list of all suggested unfoldings. Each suggested unfolding is in `whnfCore` normal form.

Additionally, eta-reduction is tried, and basic natural number reduction is tried.

## Filtering

`HAdd.hAdd` in `1+1` actually first unfolds into `Add.add`, but this is not very useful,
because this is just unfolding a notational type class. Therefore, unfoldings of default instances
are not presented in the list of suggested rewrites.
This is implemented with `unfoldProjDefaultInst?`.

Additionally, we don't want to unfold into expressions involving `match` terms or other
constants marked as `Name.isInternalDetail`. So all such results are filtered out.
This is implemented with `isUserFriendly`.

- After each unfolding, we apply `whnfCore` to simplify the expression.
- Explicit natural number expressions are evaluated.
- Unfolds of class projections of instances marked with `@[default_instance]` are not shown.
  This is relevant for notational type classes like `+`: we don't want to suggest `Add.add a b`
  as an unfolding of `a + b`. Similarly for `OfNat n : Nat` which unfolds into `n : Nat`.

To use `unfold?`, shift-click an expression in the tactic state.
