# `rfl` tactic extension for reflexive relations

This extends the `rfl` tactic so that it works on any reflexive relation,
provided the reflexivity lemma has been marked as `@[refl]`.

/-- `MetaM` version of the `rfl` tactic.

This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`, where `~` is a reflexive
relation, that is, a relation which has a reflexive lemma tagged with the attribute [refl].
