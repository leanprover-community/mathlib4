# `Lean.MVarId.liftReflToEq`

Convert a goal of the form `x ~ y` into the form `x = y`, where `~` is a reflexive
relation, that is, a relation which has a reflexive lemma tagged with the attribute `[refl]`.
If this can't be done, returns the original `MVarId`.

This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`, where `~` is a reflexive
relation, that is, a relation which has a reflexive lemma tagged with the attribute [refl].
