# Finiteness tactic

This file implements a basic `finiteness` tactic, designed to solve goals of the form `*** < ∞` and
(equivalently) `*** ≠ ∞` in the extended nonnegative reals (`ENNReal`, aka `ℝ≥0∞`).

It works recursively according to the syntax of the expression. It is implemented as an `aesop` rule
set.

## Syntax

Standard `aesop` syntax applies. Namely one can write
* `finiteness (add unfold [def1, def2])` to make `finiteness` unfold `def1`, `def2`
* `finiteness?` for the tactic to show what proof it found
* etc
* Note that `finiteness` disables `simp`, so `finiteness (add simp [lemma1, lemma2])` does not do
  anything more than a bare `finiteness`.

We also provide `finiteness_nonterminal` as a version of `finiteness` that doesn't have to close the
goal.

## TODO

Improve `finiteness` to also deal with other situations, such as balls in proper spaces with
a locally finite measure.
