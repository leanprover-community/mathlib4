`grewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses each expression `eᵢ : Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ` (where `Rᵢ` is any two-argument
relation) as a generalized rewrite rule on the main goal, replacing occurrences of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`.
Occurrences of `bᵢ` are not rewritten, even if logically possible. Use `grewrite [← eᵢ]` to rewrite
in the other direction, replacing occurrences of `bᵢ` with `aᵢ`.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are
used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`. If `e` has parameters, the tactic will try to
fill these in by unification with the matching part of the target. Parameters are only filled in
once per rule, restricting which later rewrites can be found. Parameters that are not filled in
after unification will create side goals.

To be able to use `grewrite`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged with `@[gcongr]`.
To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also give it an `IsTrans` instance.
The strict inequality `a < b` is turned into the non-strict inequality `a ≤ b` to rewrite with it.
A future version of `grewrite` may get special support for making better use of strict inequalities.

`grw` is like `grewrite` but tries to close the goal afterwards by "cheap" (reducible) `rfl`.
To rewrite only in the `n`-th position, use `nth_grewrite n`.
This is useful when `grewrite` tries to rewrite in a position that is not valid for the given
relation.
`apply_rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` is a shorthand for `grewrite +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]`: it
interprets `· → ·` as a relation instead of adding the hypothesis as a side condition.

* `grewrite [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : R a b` in the reverse direction, replacing
  occurrences of `b` with `a`.
* `grewrite (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as configuration. See `GRewrite.Config` for
  details.
  * To let `grewrite` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
    `grewrite (transparency := default) [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
  * `grewrite +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., eₙ]` interprets `· → ·` as a relation (see `apply_rewrite`).
* `grewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

`grw [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses each expression `eᵢ : Rᵢ aᵢ bᵢ` (where `Rᵢ` is any two-argument
relation) as a generalized rewrite rule on the main goal, replacing occurrences of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`,
then tries to close the main goal by "cheap" (reducible) `rfl`.
Occurrences of `bᵢ` are not rewritten, even if logically possible. Use `grw [← eᵢ]` to rewrite
in the other direction, replacing occurrences of `bᵢ` with `aᵢ`.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are
used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`. If `e` has parameters, the tactic will try to
fill these in by unification with the matching part of the target. Parameters are only filled in
once per rule, restricting which later rewrites can be found. Parameters that are not filled in
after unification will create side goals.

To be able to use `grw`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged with `@[gcongr]`.
To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also give it an `IsTrans` instance.
The strict inequality `a < b` is turned into the non-strict inequality `a ≤ b` to rewrite with it.
A future version of `grw` may get special support for making better use of strict inequalities.

`grewrite` is like `grw` but does not try to apply `rfl` afterwards.
To rewrite only in the `n`-th position, use `nth_grw n`.
This is useful when `grw` tries to rewrite in a position that is not valid for the given relation.
`apply_rw [rules]` is a shorthand for `grw +implicationHyp [rules]`: it interprets `· → ·` as a
relation instead of adding the hypothesis as a side condition.

* `grw [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : R a b` in the reverse direction, replacing occurrences
  of `b` with `a`.
* `grw (config := cfg) [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses `cfg` as configuration. See `GRewrite.Config` for
  details.
  * To let `grw` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use
    `grw (transparency := default) [e₁, ..., eₙ]`.
  * `grw +implicationHyp [e₁, ..., e\_n]` interprets `· → ·` as a relation (see `apply_rw`).
* `grw [e₁, ..., eₙ] at l` rewrites at the location(s) `l`.

Examples:

```lean
variable {a b c d n : ℤ}

example (h₁ : a < b) (h₂ : b ≤ c) : a + d ≤ c + d := by
  grw [h₁, h₂]

example (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : a ^ 2 ≡ b ^ 2 [ZMOD n] := by
  grw [h]

example (h₁ : a ∣ b) (h₂ : b ∣ a ^ 2 * c) : a ∣ b ^ 2 * c := by
  grw [h₁] at *
  exact h₂

-- To replace the RHS with the LHS of the given relation, use the `←` notation (just like in `rw`):
example (h₁ : a < b) (h₂ : b ≤ c) : a + d ≤ c + d := by
  grw [← h₂, ← h₁]

`apply_rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` uses the expressions `e₁`, ..., `eₙ` as generalized rewrite rules, of
type `pᵢ → qᵢ`, on the main goal, replacing occurrences of `pᵢ` with `qᵢ`. The difference with
`grewrite` is that `grewrite` would turn `pᵢ` into a side goal and expect `qᵢ` to be a relation.

If an expression `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are
used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.

* `apply_rewrite [← e]` applies the rewrite rule `e : p → q` in the reverse direction, replacing
  occurrences of `q` with `p`.

`nth_grewrite n₁ ... nₖ [e₁, ..., eₙ]` is a variant of `grewrite` that for each expression
`eᵢ : R aᵢ bᵢ` only replaces the `n₁, ..., nₖ`th occurrence of `aᵢ` with `bᵢ`.
