# Basic tactics and utilities for tactic writing

This file defines some basic utilities for tactic writing, and also
- a dummy `variables` macro (which warns that the Lean 4 name is `variable`)
- the `introv` tactic, which allows the user to automatically introduce the variables of a theorem
and explicitly name the non-dependent hypotheses,
- an `assumption` macro, calling the `assumption` tactic on all goals
- the tactics `match_target` and `clear_aux_decl` (clearing all auxiliary declarations from the
context).

/-- Given two arrays of `FVarId`s, one from an old local context and the other from a new local
context, pushes `FVarAliasInfo`s into the info tree for corresponding pairs of `FVarId`s.
Recall that variables linked this way should be considered to be semantically identical.

The effect of this is, for example, the unused variable linter will see that variables
from the first array are used if corresponding variables in the second array are used. -/

The tactic `introv` allows the user to automatically introduce the variables of a theorem and
explicitly name the non-dependent hypotheses.
Any dependent hypotheses are assigned their default names.

Examples:
```
example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → b = a := by
  introv h,
  exact h.symm
```
The state after `introv h` is
```
a b : ℕ,
h : a = b
⊢ b = a
```

```
example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → ∀ c, b = c → a = c := by
  introv h₁ h₂,
  exact h₁.trans h₂
```
The state after `introv h₁ h₂` is
```
a b : ℕ,
h₁ : a = b,
c : ℕ,
h₂ : b = c
⊢ a = c
```
