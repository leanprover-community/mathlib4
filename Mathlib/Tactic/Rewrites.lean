# The `rewrites` tactic.

`rewrites` tries to find a lemma which can rewrite the goal.

`rewrites` should not be left in proofs; it is a search tool, like `library_search`.

Suggestions are printed as `rw [h]` or `rw [←h]`.

## Future work
It would be nice to have `rewrites at h`.

We could also try discharging side goals via `assumption` or `solve_by_elim`.
