# The `by_cases` tactic

The `by_cases!` tactic is a variant of the `by_cases` tactic that also calls `push_neg`.
-/

/--
`by_cases! h : p` runs the `by_cases h : p` tactic, followed by
`try push_neg at h` in the second subgoals.

For example, `by_cases! h : a < b` creates one goal with the hypothesis `h : a < b` and
one goal with `h : b â‰¤ a`.
