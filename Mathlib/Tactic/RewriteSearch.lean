# The `rw_search` tactic

`rw_search` attempts to solve an equality goal
by repeatedly rewriting using lemmas from the library.

If no solution is found,
the best sequence of rewrites found before `maxHeartbeats` elapses is returned.

The search is a best-first search, minimising the Levenshtein edit distance between
the pretty-printed expressions on either side of the equality.
(The strings are tokenized at spaces,
separating delimiters `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, and `,` into their own tokens.)

The implementation avoids completely computing edit distances where possible,
only computing lower bounds sufficient to decide which path to take in the search.

# Future improvements

We could call `simp` as an atomic step of rewriting.

The edit distance heuristic could be replaced by something else.

No effort has been made to choose the best tokenization scheme, and this should be investigated.
Moreover, the Levenshtein distance function is customizable with different weights for each token,
and it would be interesting to try optimizing these
(or dynamically updating them,
adding weight to tokens that persistently appear on one side of the equation but not the other.)

The `rw_search` tactic will rewrite by local hypotheses,
but will not use local hypotheses to discharge side conditions. 
This limitation would need to be resolved in the `rw?` tactic first.
