# Without loss of generality tactic

The tactic `wlog h : P` will add an assumption `h : P` to the main goal,
and add a new goal that requires showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case
where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

The new goal will be placed at the top of the goal stack.

/-- `wlog goal h P xs H` will return two goals: the `hypothesisGoal`, which adds an assumption
`h : P` to the context of `goal`, and the `reductionGoal`, which requires showing that the case
`h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

In `reductionGoal`, there will be two additional assumptions:
- `h : ¬ P`: the assumption that `P` does not hold
- `H`: which is the statement that in the old context `P` suffices to prove the goal.
  If `H` is `none`, the name `this` is used.

If `xs` is `none`, all hypotheses are reverted to produce the reduction goal's hypothesis `H`.
Otherwise, the `xs` are elaborated to hypotheses in the context of `goal`, and only those
hypotheses are reverted (and any that depend on them).

If `h` is `none`, the hypotheses of types `P` and `¬ P` in both branches will be inaccessible. -/

/-- `wlog h : P` will add an assumption `h : P` to the main goal, and add a side goal that requires
showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

The side goal will be at the top of the stack. In this side goal, there will be two additional
assumptions:
- `h : ¬ P`: the assumption that `P` does not hold
- `this`: which is the statement that in the old context `P` suffices to prove the goal.
  By default, the name `this` is used, but the idiom `with H` can be added to specify the name:
  `wlog h : P with H`.

Typically, it is useful to use the variant `wlog h : P generalizing x y`,
to revert certain parts of the context before creating the new goal.
In this way, the wlog-claim `this` can be applied to `x` and `y` in different orders
(exploiting symmetry, which is the typical use case).

By default, the entire context is reverted. -/
