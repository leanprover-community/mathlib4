# Library search

This file defines tactics `exact?` and `apply?`,
(formerly known as `library_search`)
and a term elaborator `exact?%`
that tries to find a lemma
solving the current goal
(subgoals are solved using `solveByElim`).

```
example : x < x + 1 := exact?%
example : Nat := by exact?
```

Try to solve the goal either by:
* calling `solveByElim`
* or applying a library lemma then calling `solveByElim` on the resulting goals.

If it successfully closes the goal, returns `none`.
Otherwise, it returns `some a`, where `a : Array (MetavarContext × List MVarId)`,
with an entry for each library lemma which was successfully applied,
containing the metavariable context after the application, and a list of the subsidiary goals.

(Always succeeds, and the metavariable context stored in the monad is reverted,
unless the goal was completely solved.)

(Note that if `solveByElim` solves some but not all subsidiary goals,
this is not currently tracked.)
