# Measurability

The `measurability` attribute used to tag measurability statements for the `measurability` tactic.

Note that `measurability` uses `fun_prop` for solving measurability of functions, so statements
about `Measurable`, `AEMeasurable`, `StronglyMeasurable` and `AEStronglyMeasurable` should be tagged
with `fun_prop` rather that `measurability`. The `measurability` attribute is equivalent to
`fun_prop` in these cases for backward compatibility with the earlier implementation.

The tactic `measurability` solves goals of the form `Measurable f`, `AEMeasurable f`,
`StronglyMeasurable f`, `AEStronglyMeasurable f μ`, or `MeasurableSet s` by applying lemmas tagged
with the `measurability` user attribute.

The tactic `measurability?` solves goals of the form `Measurable f`, `AEMeasurable f`,
`StronglyMeasurable f`, `AEStronglyMeasurable f μ`, or `MeasurableSet s` by applying lemmas tagged
with the `measurability` user attribute, and suggests a faster proof script that can be substituted
for the tactic call in case of success. -/

-- Todo: implement `measurability!` and `measurability!?` and add configuration,
-- original syntax was (same for the missing `measurability` variants):
syntax (name := measurability!) "measurability!" : tactic
syntax (name := measurability!?) "measurability!?" : tactic
