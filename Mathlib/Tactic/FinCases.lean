# The `fin_cases` tactic.

Given a hypothesis of the form `h : x ∈ (A : List α)`, `x ∈ (A : Finset α)`,
or `x ∈ (A : Multiset α)`,
or a hypothesis of the form `h : A`, where `[Fintype A]` is available,
`fin_cases h` will repeatedly call `cases` to split the goal into
separate cases for each possible value.

Recursively runs the `cases` tactic on a hypothesis `h`.
As long as two goals are produced, `cases` is called recursively on the second goal,
and we return a list of the first goals which appeared.

This is useful for hypotheses of the form `h : a ∈ [l₁, l₂, ...]`,
which will be transformed into a sequence of goals with hypotheses `h : a = l₁`, `h : a = l₂`,
and so on.

`fin_cases h` performs case analysis on a hypothesis of the form
`h : A`, where `[Fintype A]` is available, or
`h : a ∈ A`, where `A : Finset X`, `A : Multiset X` or `A : List X`.

As an example, in
```
example (f : ℕ → Prop) (p : Fin 3) (h0 : f 0) (h1 : f 1) (h2 : f 2) : f p.val := by
  fin_cases p; simp
  all_goals assumption
```
after `fin_cases p; simp`, there are three goals, `f 0`, `f 1`, and `f 2`.

/-!
`fin_cases` used to also have two modifiers, `fin_cases ... with ...` and `fin_cases ... using ...`.
With neither actually used in mathlib, they haven't been re-implemented here.

In case someone finds a need for them, and wants to re-implement, the relevant sections of
the doc-string are preserved here:

---

`fin_cases h with l` takes a list of descriptions for the cases of `h`.
These should be definitionally equal to and in the same order as the
default enumeration of the cases.

For example,
```
example (x y : ℕ) (h : x ∈ [1, 2]) : x = y := by
  fin_cases h with 1, 1+1
```
produces two cases: `1 = y` and `1 + 1 = y`.

When using `fin_cases a` on data `a` defined with `let`,
the tactic will not be able to clear the variable `a`,
and will instead produce hypotheses `this : a = ...`.
These hypotheses can be given a name using `fin_cases a using ha`.

For example,
```
example (f : ℕ → Fin 3) : True := by
  let a := f 3
  fin_cases a using ha
```
produces three goals with hypotheses
`ha : a = 0`, `ha : a = 1`, and `ha : a = 2`.

/- TODO: In mathlib3 we ran `norm_num` when there is no `with` clause. Is this still useful? -/
/- TODO: can we name the cases generated according to their values,
   rather than `tail.tail.tail.head`? -/
