# The Following Are Equivalent (TFAE)

This file provides the tactics `tfae`, `tfae_have`, and `tfae_finish` for proving goals of the form
`TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`.

The `tfae` block tactic is now preferred, but `tfae_have` and `tfae_finish` are still supported for
implementation purposes and backwards compatibility.

Example:
```lean
  tfae
    1 → 2 := /- proof of `P₁ → P₂` -/
    2 → 3 := /- proof of `P₂ → P₃` -/
    3 → 1 := /- proof of `P₃ → P₁` -/
```
See the dosctring for `tfae` for more information.

## 'Old-style' `tfae` (`tfae_have` and `tfae_finish`)

Although the `tfae` block tactic is now preferred (see below), we preserve the following parsers
for backwards compatibility and implementation.

We implement `tfae_have` in terms of a syntactic `have`. To support as much of the same syntax as
possible, we recreate the parsers for `have`, except with the changes necessary for `tfae_have`.
The following parsers are similar to those for `have` in `Lean.Parser.Term`, but
instead of `optType`, we use `tfaeType := num >> impArrow >> num` (as a `tfae_have` invocation must
always include this specification). Also, we disallow including extra binders, as that makes no
sense in this context; we also include `" : "` after the binder to avoid breaking `tfae_have 1 → 2`
syntax (which, unlike `have`, omits `" : "`).
-/

/- See `haveIdLhs`.

We omit `many (ppSpace >> letIdBinder)`, as it makes no sense to add extra arguments to a
`tfae_have` decl.  -/

NOTE: The `tfae` block tactic is now preferred in place of `tfae_have` and `tfae_finish`, e.g.
```lean
  tfae
    1 → 2 := /- proof of `P₁ → P₂` -/
    2 → 3 := /- proof of `P₂ → P₃` -/
    3 → 1 := /- proof of `P₃ → P₁` -/
```

See `tfae`.

`tfae_have` introduces hypotheses for proving goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`. Specifically,
`tfae_have i <arrow> j := ...` introduces a hypothesis of type `Pᵢ <arrow> Pⱼ` to the local
context, where `<arrow>` can be `→`, `←`, or `↔`. Note that `i` and `j` are natural number indices
(beginning at 1) used to specify the propositions `P₁, P₂, ...` that appear in the goal.

```lean
example (h : P → R) : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 3 := h
  ...
```
The resulting context now includes `tfae_1_to_3 : P → R`.

Once sufficient hypotheses have been introduced by `tfae_have`, `tfae_finish` can be used to close
the goal. For example,

```lean
example : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry /- proof of P → Q -/
  tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry /- proof of Q → P -/
  tfae_have 2 ↔ 3 := sorry /- proof of Q ↔ R -/
  tfae_finish
```

All relevant features of `have` are supported by `tfae_have`, including naming, destructuring, goal
creation, and matching. These are demonstrated below.

```lean
example : TFAE [P, Q] := by
  -- `tfae_1_to_2 : P → Q`:
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry
  -- `hpq : P → Q`:
  tfae_have hpq : 1 → 2 := sorry
  -- inaccessible `h✝ : P → Q`:
  tfae_have _ : 1 → 2 := sorry
  -- `tfae_1_to_2 : P → Q`, and `?a` is a new goal:
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := f ?a
  -- create a goal of type `P → Q`:
  tfae_have 1 → 2
  · exact (sorry : P → Q)
  -- match on `p : P` and prove `Q`:
  tfae_have 1 → 2
  | p => f p
  -- introduces `pq : P → Q`, `qp : Q → P`:
  tfae_have ⟨pq, qp⟩ : 1 ↔ 2 := sorry
  ...

`tfae_finish` is used to close goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]` once a sufficient collection
of hypotheses of the form `Pᵢ → Pⱼ` or `Pᵢ ↔ Pⱼ` have been introduced to the local context.

`tfae_have` can be used to conveniently introduce these hypotheses; see `tfae_have`.

Example:
```lean
example : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry /- proof of P → Q -/
  tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry /- proof of Q → P -/

## The `tfae` block tactic

The following currently relies on the 'old-style' parsers for implementation.

`tfaeFields` parses e.g.
```
  1 → 2 := sorry
  2 → 3 := sorry
  ...
```
(including other variations of the `tfaeHaveDecl`) and is patterned loosely off of the
`structFields` parser used for declaring structures.
-/

private def tfaeFields := leading_parser manyIndent <| ppLine >> checkColGe >> ppGroup tfaeHaveDecl

/-- The `tfae` tactic is used for proving goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`. For example,
given a goal `TFAE [P₁, P₂, P₃]`, we can prove it with
```lean
  tfae
    1 → 2 := /- proof of `P₁ → P₂` -/
    2 → 3 := /- proof of `P₂ → P₃` -/
    3 → 1 := /- proof of `P₃ → P₁` -/
```
In `i → j := ...`, `i` and `j` are natural-number indices which refer to the proposition at the
corresponding position in the `TFAE` goal list, starting at `1` (not `0`).

Both `→` and `↔` can be used to specify subgoals, e.g. ```lean 2 ↔ 3 := /- proof of `P₂ ↔ P₃`-/``.
(`i ← j` can also be used as shorthand for `j → i`.)

`match`-style alternatives can also be used to prove an implication as usual, e.g.
```lean
  tfae
    1 → 2 := ...
    2 → 3
    | h₂ => /- proof of `P₃` -/
    3 → 1 -- given `P₁ := ∀(a : A), (b : B), (c : C), X`:
    | h₃, a, b, c => /- proof of `X` -/
```

Once e.g. `2 → 3` has been proved, it appears in the local context during proofs of subsequent
implications as `tfae_2_to_3 : P₂ → P₃`. If desired, a custom name can be given using the syntax
`h : 2 → 3 := ...` Patterns can also be used here to introduce `Iff` fields individually, e.g.
`⟨h_mp, h_mpr⟩ : 5 ↔ 6 := ...`.

/-! ## `tfae` block tactic

This is currently implemented simply in terms of `tfae_have` and `tfae_finish`.

TODO: prevent `tfae_have` from being able to introduce new subgoals. Since `tfae_have` is defined
in terms of `have`, we're allowed to write e.g. `1 → 2 := f ?a`, which will introduce `?a` as a
subgoal.

TODO: eliminate `tfae_finish` and take advantage of the nature of the block tactic. `tfae_finish`
currently looks through the entire local context for implications, since it can't communicate
directly with prior uses of `tfae_have`. However, since we have all of the indices available to the
block tactic at once (and links between them), we can:
1. figure out the structure of the proof term more efficiently
2. (automatic from `1`) make sure all necessary implications are specified explicitly as fields.
Currently an implication in the local context not introduced by `tfae` could be used by
`tfae_finish`, which hampers readability. Although this doesn't happen in practice.
3. alert the user to unused fields (currently we wait on the "unused `have`" linter in CI)
