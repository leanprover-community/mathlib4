# The `fconstructor` and `econstructor` tactics

The `fconstructor` and `econstructor` tactics are variants of the `constructor` tactic in Lean core,
except that
- `fconstructor` does not reorder goals
- `econstructor` adds only non-dependent premises as new goals.

`fconstructor` is like `constructor`
(it calls `apply` using the first matching constructor of an inductive datatype)
except that it does not reorder goals.
