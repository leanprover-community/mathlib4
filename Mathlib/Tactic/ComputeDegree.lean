# `compute_degree` and `monicity`: tactics for explicit polynomials

This file defines two related tactics: `compute_degree` and `monicity`.

Using `compute_degree` when the goal is of one of the five forms
*  `natDegree f ≤ d`,
*  `degree f ≤ d`,
*  `natDegree f = d`,
*  `degree f = d`,
*  `coeff f d = r`, if `d` is the degree of `f`,
tries to solve the goal.
It may leave side-goals, in case it is not entirely successful.

Using `monicity` when the goal is of the form `Monic f` tries to solve the goal.
It may leave side-goals, in case it is not entirely successful.

Both tactics admit a `!` modifier (`compute_degree!` and `monicity!`) instructing
Lean to try harder to close the goal.

See the doc-strings for more details.

##  Future work

* Currently, `compute_degree` does not deal correctly with some edge cases.  For instance,
  ```lean
  example [Semiring R] : natDegree (C 0 : R[X]) = 0 := by
    compute_degree
  --  ⊢ 0 ≠ 0
  ```
  Still, it may not be worth to provide special support for `natDegree f = 0`.
* Make sure that numerals in coefficients are treated correctly.
* Make sure that `compute_degree` works with goals of the form `degree f ≤ ↑d`, with an
  explicit coercion from `ℕ` on the RHS.
* Add support for proving goals of the from `natDegree f ≠ 0` and `degree f ≠ 0`.
* Make sure that `degree`, `natDegree` and `coeff` are equally supported.

##  Implementation details

Assume that `f : R[X]` is a polynomial with coefficients in a semiring `R` and
`d` is either in `ℕ` or in `WithBot ℕ`.
If the goal has the form `natDegree f = d`, then we convert it to three separate goals:
* `natDegree f ≤ d`;
* `coeff f d = r`;
* `r ≠ 0`.

Similarly, an initial goal of the form `degree f = d` gives rise to goals of the form
* `degree f ≤ d`;
* `coeff f d = r`;
* `r ≠ 0`.

Next, we apply successively lemmas whose side-goals all have the shape
* `natDegree f ≤ d`;
* `degree f ≤ d`;
* `coeff f d = r`;

plus possibly "numerical" identities and choices of elements in `ℕ`, `WithBot ℕ`, and `R`.

Recursing into `f`, we break apart additions, multiplications, powers, subtractions,...
The leaves of the process are
* numerals, `C a`, `X` and `monomial a n`, to which we assign degree `0`, `1` and `a` respectively;
* `fvar`s `f`, to which we tautologically assign degree `natDegree f`.

###  Simple lemmas about `natDegree`

The lemmas in this section all have the form `natDegree <some form of cast> ≤ 0`.
Their proofs are weakenings of the stronger lemmas `natDegree <same> = 0`.
These are the lemmas called by `compute_degree` on (almost) all the leaves of its recursion.

/--  The following two lemmas should be viewed as a hand-made "congr"-lemmas.
They achieve the following goals.
* They introduce *two* fresh metavariables replacing the given one `deg`,
  one for the `natDegree ≤` computation and one for the `coeff =` computation.
  This helps `compute_degree`, since it does not "pre-estimate" the degree,
  but it "picks it up along the way".
* They split checking the inequality `coeff p n ≠ 0` into the task of
  finding a value `c` for the `coeff` and then
  proving that this value is non-zero by `coeff_ne_zero`.

/-- `twoHeadsArgs e` takes an `Expr`ession `e` as input and recurses into `e` to make sure
the `e` looks like `lhs ≤ rhs` or `lhs = rhs` and that `lhs` is one of
`natDegree f, degree f, coeff f d`.
It returns
* the function being applied on the LHS (`natDegree`, `degree`, or `coeff`),
  or else `.anonymous` if it's none of these.
* the name of the relation (`Eq` or `LE.le`), or else `.anonymous` if it's none of these.

  * or `.inl .anonymous` if inapplicable
* if it exists, whether the `rhs` is a metavariable
* if the LHS is `coeff f d`, whether `d` is a metavariable

This is all the data needed to figure out whether `compute_degree` can make progress on `e`
and, if so, which lemma it should apply.

Sample outputs:
* `natDegree (f + g) ≤ d => (natDegree, LE.le, HAdd.hAdd, d.isMVar, none)` (similarly for `=`);

* `coeff (1 : ℕ[X]) c = x => (coeff, Eq, one, x.isMVar, c.isMVar)` (no `≤` option!).

`getCongrLemma (lhs_name, rel_name, Mvars?)` returns the name of a lemma that preprocesses
one of the five target
*  `natDegree f ≤ d`;
*  `natDegree f = d`.
*  `degree f ≤ d`;
*  `degree f = d`.
*  `coeff f d = r`.

The end goals are of the form
* `natDegree f ≤ ?_`, `degree f ≤ ?_`, `coeff f ?_ = ?_`, with fresh metavariables;
* `coeff f m ≠ s` with `m, s` not necessarily metavariables;
* several equalities/inequalities between expressions and assignments for metavariables.

`getCongrLemma` gets called at the very beginning of `compute_degree` and whenever an intermediate
goal does not have the right metavariables.
Note that the side-goals of the congruence lemma are neither of the form `natDegree f = d` nor
of the form `degree f = d`.

`getCongrLemma` admits an optional "debug" flag: `getCongrLemma data true` prints the name of
the congruence lemma that it returns.

and `x` is an expression that does not involve metavariables, then it closes this goal using `rfl`,
effectively assigning the metavariable to `x`.

If a goal does not contain metavariables, it tries `rfl` on it.

It returns the list of `MVarId`s, beginning with the ones that initially involved (`Expr`)
metavariables followed by the rest.

namely, goals of the form

`splitApply` determines which of these goals are actually within the scope, it applies the relevant

concatenation of the previous `static` list, followed by the newly discovered goals outside of the
scope of `compute_degree`. -/

Although inconsequential for this function, the list of goals `false_goals` reduces to `False`
if `norm_num`med.
`miscomputedDegree?` extracts error information from goals of the form
*  `a ≠ b`, assuming it comes from `⊢ coeff_of_given_degree ≠ 0`
   -- reducing to `False` means that the coefficient that was supposed to vanish, does not;

*  `a = b`, assuming it comes from `⊢ computed_degree ≤ given_degree`
   -- reducing to `False` means that there is a term of degree that is apparently too large.

The cases `a ≠ b` and `a = b` are not a perfect match with the top coefficient:
reducing to `False` is not exactly correlated with a coefficient being non-zero.
It does mean that `compute_degree` reduced the initial goal to an unprovable state
(unless there was already a contradiction in the initial hypotheses!), but it is indicative that
there may be some problem.

`compute_degree` is a tactic to solve goals of the form
*  `natDegree f = d`,
*  `degree f = d`,
*  `natDegree f ≤ d`,
*  `degree f ≤ d`,
*  `coeff f d = r`, if `d` is the degree of `f`.

The tactic may leave goals of the form `d' = d` `d' ≤ d`, or `r ≠ 0`, where `d'` in `ℕ` or
`WithBot ℕ` is the tactic's guess of the degree, and `r` is the coefficient's guess of the
leading coefficient of `f`.

`compute_degree` applies `norm_num` to the left-hand side of all side goals, trying to clos them.

The variant `compute_degree!` first applies `compute_degree`.
Then it uses `norm_num` on all the whole remaining goals and tries `assumption`.

/-- `monicity` tries to solve a goal of the form `Monic f`.
It converts the goal into a goal of the form `natDegree f ≤ n` and one of the form `f.coeff n = 1`
and calls `compute_degree` on those two goals.

The variant `monicity!` starts like `monicity`, but calls `compute_degree!` on the two side-goals.
