# `#formalize` command, requesting auto-formalization via a large language model.

You must have a large language model available for this to work.

Recommended is to use an OpenAI API key, with available quota,
stored in the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` for this to work.
We start by trying the "gpt-4" model, but if this is not available we fall back automatically to
"gpt-3.5-turbo".

If you don't have access to GPT, or don't want to use it, it is also possible
to use local LLMs. Running #formalize will fail, but print instructions for
setting one up.

You may include a short natural language explanation as a doc-string.

`#formalize "There are infinitely many prime numbers."` will attempt to use a langauge model
to write the formalization of your statement in Lean (but not the proof!)

The string must end with a '.' or '?'.

The first time you run `#formalize`
the help text will explain how to set up a compatible langauge model.
