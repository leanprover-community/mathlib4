# Attributes used in `Mathlib`

In this file we define all `simp`-like and `label`-like attributes used in `Mathlib`. We declare all
of them in one file for two reasons:

- in Lean 4, one cannot use an attribute in the same file where it was declared;
- this way it is easy to see which simp sets contain a given lemma.

/-- Simp set for `functor_norm` -/
register_simp_attr functor_norm

-- Porting note:
-- in mathlib3 we declared `monad_norm` using:
--   mk_simp_attribute monad_norm none with functor_norm
-- This syntax is not supported by mathlib4's `register_simp_attr`.
-- See https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/802
-- TODO: add `@[monad_norm]` to all `@[functor_norm] lemmas

/-- Simp set for `functor_norm` -/
register_simp_attr monad_norm

/-- The simpset `field_simps` is used by the tactic `field_simp` to
reduce an expression in a field to an expression of the form `n / d` where `n` and `d` are
division-free. -/
register_simp_attr field_simps

/-- Simp attribute for lemmas about `Even` -/
register_simp_attr parity_simps

/-- "Simp attribute for lemmas about `IsROrC`" -/
register_simp_attr isROrC_simps

/-- The simpset `qify_simps` is used by the tactic `qify` to moved expression from `ℕ` or `ℤ` to `ℚ`
which gives a well-behaved division. -/
register_simp_attr qify_simps

/-- The simpset `zify_simps` is used by the tactic `zify` to moved expression from `ℕ` to `ℤ`
which gives a well-behaved subtraction. -/
register_simp_attr zify_simps

/--
The simpset `mfld_simps` records several simp lemmas that are
especially useful in manifolds. It is a subset of the whole set of simp lemmas, but it makes it
possible to have quicker proofs (when used with `squeeze_simp` or `simp only`) while retaining
readability.

The typical use case is the following, in a file on manifolds:
If `simp [foo, bar]` is slow, replace it with `squeeze_simp [foo, bar, mfld_simps]` and paste
its output. The list of lemmas should be reasonable (contrary to the output of
`squeeze_simp [foo, bar]` which might contain tens of lemmas), and the outcome should be quick
enough.
-/
register_simp_attr mfld_simps

/-- Simp set for integral rules. -/
register_simp_attr integral_simps

/-- simp set for the manipulation of typevec and arrow expressions -/
register_simp_attr typevec

/-- Simplification rules for ghost equations. -/
register_simp_attr ghost_simps

/-- The `@[nontriviality]` simp set is used by the `nontriviality` tactic to automatically
discharge theorems about the trivial case (where we know `Subsingleton α` and many theorems
in e.g. groups are trivially true). -/
register_simp_attr nontriviality

/-- A stub attribute for `is_poly`. -/
register_label_attr is_poly
