# linear_combination Tactic

In this file, the `linear_combination` tactic is created.  This tactic, which
works over `CommRing`s, attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target. A `Syntax.Tactic`
object can also be passed into the tactic, allowing the user to specify a
normalization tactic.

## Implementation Notes

This tactic works by creating a weighted sum of the given equations with the
given coefficients.  Then, it subtracts the right side of the weighted sum
from the left side so that the right side equals 0, and it does the same with
the target.  Afterwards, it sets the goal to be the equality between the
lefthand side of the new goal and the lefthand side of the new weighted sum.
Lastly, calls a normalization tactic on this target.

Performs macro expansion of a linear combination expression,
using `+`/`-`/`*`/`/` on equations and values.
* `.proof p` means that `p` is a syntax corresponding to a proof of an equation.
  For example, if `h : a = b` then `expandLinearCombo (2 * h)` returns `.proof (c_add_pf 2 h)`
  which is a proof of `2 * a = 2 * b`.
* `.const c` means that the input expression is not an equation but a value.

The `(norm := $tac)` syntax says to use `tac` as a normalization postprocessor for
`linear_combination`. The default normalizer is `ring1`, but you can override it with `ring_nf`
to get subgoals from `linear_combination` or with `skip` to disable normalization.

/--
`linear_combination` attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
  of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target.
  The tactic will create a linear
  combination by adding the equalities together from left to right, so the order
  of the input hypotheses does matter.  If the `normalize` field of the
  configuration is set to false, then the tactic will simply set the user up to
  prove their target using the linear combination instead of normalizing the subtraction.

Note: The left and right sides of all the equalities should have the same type `α`, and the
coefficients should also have type `α`.  For full functionality `α` should be a commutative ring --
strictly speaking, a commutative semiring with "cancellative" addition (in the semiring case,
negation and subtraction will be handled "formally" as if operating in the enveloping ring). If a
nonstandard normalization is used (for example `abel` or `skip`), the tactic will work over types
`α` with less algebraic structure: the minimum is instances of `[Add α] [IsRightCancelAdd α]`
together with instances of whatever operations are used in the tactic call.

* The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of proofs of equalities,
  given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
  The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions.
  The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving equalities.
  Most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1, h2, ...`.
* `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` runs the "normalization tactic" `tac`
  on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
  * The default normalization tactic is `ring1`, which closes the goal or fails.
  * To get a subgoal in the case that it is not immediately provable, use
    `ring_nf` as the normalization tactic.
  * To avoid normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
* `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before subtracting the
  combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination (exp := n) e`
  will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above.
