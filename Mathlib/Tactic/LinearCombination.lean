# linear_combination Tactic

In this file, the `linear_combination` tactic is created.  This tactic, which
works over `CommRing`s, attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target. A `Syntax.Tactic`
object can also be passed into the tactic, allowing the user to specify a
normalization tactic.

Over ordered algebraic objects (such as `LinearOrderedCommRing`), taking linear combinations of
inequalities is also supported.

## Implementation Notes

This tactic works by creating a weighted sum of the given equations with the
given coefficients.  Then, it subtracts the right side of the weighted sum
from the left side so that the right side equals 0, and it does the same with
the target.  Afterwards, it sets the goal to be the equality between the
lefthand side of the new goal and the lefthand side of the new weighted sum.
Lastly, calls a normalization tactic on this target.

/-- The handling in `linear_combination` of left- and right-multiplication and scalar-multiplication
and of division all five proceed according to the same logic, specified here: given a proof `p` of
an (in)equality and a constant `c`,
* if `p` is a proof of an equation, multiply/divide through by `c`;
* if `p` is a proof of a non-strict inequality, run `positivity` to find a proof that `c` is
  nonnegative, then multiply/divide through by `c`, invoking the nonnegativity of `c` where needed;
* if `p` is a proof of a strict inequality, run `positivity` to find a proof that `c` is positive
  (if possible) or nonnegative (if not), then multiply/divide through by `c`, invoking the
  positivity or nonnegativity of `c` where needed.

This generic logic takes as a parameter the object `lems`: the four lemmas corresponding to the four
cases. -/

Performs macro expansion of a linear combination expression,
using `+`/`-`/`*`/`/` on equations and values.
* `.proof eq p` means that `p` is a syntax corresponding to a proof of an equation.
  For example, if `h : a = b` then `expandLinearCombo (2 * h)` returns `.proof (c_add_pf 2 h)`
  which is a proof of `2 * a = 2 * b`.
  Similarly, `.proof le p` means that `p` is a syntax corresponding to a proof of a non-strict
  inequality, and `.proof lt p` means that `p` is a syntax corresponding to a proof of a strict
  inequality.
* `.const c` means that the input expression is not an equation but a value.

The `(norm := $tac)` syntax says to use `tac` as a normalization postprocessor for
`linear_combination`. The default normalizer is `ring1`, but you can override it with `ring_nf`
to get subgoals from `linear_combination` or with `skip` to disable normalization.

/--
The `linear_combination` tactic attempts to prove an (in)equality goal by exhibiting it as a
specified linear combination of (in)equality hypotheses, or other (in)equality proof terms, modulo
(A) moving terms between the LHS and RHS of the (in)equalities, and (B) a normalization tactic
which by default is ring-normalization.

Example usage:
```
example {a b : ℚ} (h1 : a = 1) (h2 : b = 3) : (a + b) / 2 = 2 := by
  linear_combination (h1 + h2) / 2

example {a b : ℚ} (h1 : a ≤ 1) (h2 : b ≤ 3) : (a + b) / 2 ≤ 2 := by
  linear_combination (h1 + h2) / 2

example {a b : ℚ} : 2 * a * b ≤ a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 := by
  linear_combination sq_nonneg (a - b)

example {x y z w : ℤ} (h₁ : x * z = y ^ 2) (h₂ : y * w = z ^ 2) :
    z * (x * w - y * z) = 0 := by
  linear_combination w * h₁ + y * h₂

example {x : ℚ} (h : x ≥ 5) : x ^ 2 > 2 * x + 11 := by
  linear_combination (x + 3) * h

example {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {a b : R} (h : a = b) : a ^ 2 = b ^ 2 := by
  linear_combination (a + b) * h

example {A : Type*} [AddCommGroup A]
    {x y z : A} (h1 : x + y = 10 • z) (h2 : x - y = 6 • z) :
    2 • x = 2 • (8 • z) := by
  linear_combination (norm := abel) h1 + h2

example (x y : ℤ) (h1 : x * y + 2 * x = 1) (h2 : x = y) :
    x * y = -2 * y + 1 := by
  linear_combination (norm := ring_nf) -2 * h2
  -- leaves goal `⊢ x * y + x * 2 - 1 = 0`
```

The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of proofs of (in)equalities,
given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions (with nonnegativity constraints in the case of
inequalities).
The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving (in)equalities;
most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1`, `h2`, ....

The left and right sides of all the (in)equalities should have the same type `α`, and the
coefficients should also have type `α`.  For full functionality `α` should be a commutative ring --
strictly speaking, a commutative semiring with "cancellative" addition (in the semiring case,
negation and subtraction will be handled "formally" as if operating in the enveloping ring). If a
nonstandard normalization is used (for example `abel` or `skip`), the tactic will work over types
`α` with less algebraic structure: for equalities, the minimum is instances of
`[Add α] [IsRightCancelAdd α]` together with instances of whatever operations are used in the tactic
call.

The variant `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` specifies explicitly the "normalization tactic"
`tac` to be run on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
* The default normalization tactic is `ring1` (for equalities) or `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.prove{LE,LT}`
  (for inequalities). These are finishing tactics: they close the goal or fail.
* When working in algebraic categories other than commutative rings -- for example fields, abelian
  groups, modules -- it is sometimes useful to use normalization tactics adapted to those categories
  (`field_simp`, `abel`, `module`).
* To skip normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
* The `linear_combination` tactic creates a linear combination by adding the provided (in)equalities
  together from left to right, so if `tac` is not invariant under commutation of additive
  expressions, then the order of the input hypotheses can matter.

The variant `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before
subtracting the combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`,
`linear_combination (exp := n) e` will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as
above.  This variant is implemented only for linear combinations of equalities (i.e., not for
inequalities).
