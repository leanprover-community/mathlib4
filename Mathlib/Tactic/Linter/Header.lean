#  The "header" linter

The "header" style linter checks that a file starts with
```
/-
Copyright ...
Apache ...

-/

import statements*
module doc-string*
remaining file
```
It emits a warning if
* the copyright statement is malformed;
* `Mathlib.Tactic` is imported;
* any import in `Lake` is present;
* the first non-`import` command is not a module doc-string.

The linter allows `import`-only files and does not require a copyright statement in `Mathlib.Init`.

## Implementation
The strategy used by the linter is as follows.
The linter computes the end position of the first module doc-string of the file,
resorting to the end of the file, if there is no module doc-string.
Next, the linter tries to parse the file up to the position determined above.

If the parsing is successful, the linter checks the resulting `Syntax` and behaves accordingly.

If the parsing is not successful, this already means there is some "problematic" command
after the imports. In particular, there is a command that is not a module doc-string
immediately following the last import: the file should be flagged by the linter.
Hence, the linter then falls back to parsing the header of the file, adding a spurious `section`
after it.
This makes it possible for the linter to check the entire header of the file, emit warnings that
could arise from this part and also flag that the file should contain a module doc-string after
the `import` statements.

open Lean Elab Command

namespace Mathlib.Linter

/--
`firstNonImport? stx` assumes that the input `Syntax` is of kind `Lean.Parser.Module.module`.
It returns
* `none`, if `stx` consists only of `import` statements,
* the first non-`import` command in `stx`, otherwise.

The intended use-case is to use the output of `testParseModule` as the input of
`firstNonImport?`.
-/
def firstNonImport? : Syntax → Option Syntax
  | .node _ ``Lean.Parser.Module.module #[_header, .node _ `null args] => args[0]?
  | _=> some .missing  -- this is unreachable, if the input comes from `testParseModule`

/-- `getImportIds s` takes as input `s : Syntax`.
It returns the array of all `import` identifiers in `s`. -/
-- We cannot use `importsOf` instead, as
-- - that function is defined in the `ImportGraph` project; we would like to minimise imports
--   to Mathlib.Init (where this linter is imported)
-- - that function does not return the Syntax corresponding to each import,
--   which we use to log more precise warnings.
partial
def getImportIds (s : Syntax) : Array Syntax :=
  let rest : Array Syntax := (s.getArgs.map getImportIds).flatten
  if s.isOfKind ``Lean.Parser.Module.import then
    rest.push (s.getArgs.getD 2 default)
  else
    rest

/--
`parseUpToHere pos post` takes as input `pos : String.Pos` and the optional `post : String`.
It parses the current file from the beginning until `pos`, appending `post` at the end.
It returns a syntax node of kind `Lean.Parser.Module.module`.
The option of appending a final string to the text gives more control to avoid syntax errors,
for instance in the presence of `#guard_msgs in` or `set_option ... in`.

Note that this parsing will *not* be successful on every file.  However, if the linter is
parsing the file linearly, it will only need to parse
* the imports (that are always parseable) and
* the first non-import command that is supposed to be a module doc-string (so again always
  parseable).

In conclusion, either the parsing is successful, and the linter can continue with its analysis,
or the parsing is not successful and the linter will flag a missing module doc-string!

  take place; the embedded string is the current text that the linter flagged;
* the `String` factor is the linter message.

The linter checks that
* the first and last line of the copyright are a `("/-", "-/")` pair, each on its own line;
* the first line is begins with `Copyright (c) 20` and ends with `. All rights reserved.`;
* the second line is `Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.`;
* the remainder of the string begins with `Authors: `, does not end with `.` and
  contains no ` and ` nor a double space, except possibly after a line break.
