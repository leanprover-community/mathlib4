#  The "multiGoal" linter

The "multiGoal" linter emits a warning where there is more than a single goal in scope.
There is an exception: a tactic that closes *all* remaining goals is allowed.

There are a few tactics, such as `skip`, `swap` or the `try` combinator, that are intended to work
specifically in such a situation.
Otherwise, the mathlib style guide ask that goals be focused until there is only one active goal
at a time.
If this focusing does not happen, the linter emits a warning.
Typically, the focusing is achieved by the `cdot`: `·`, but, e.g., `focus` or `on_goal x`
also serve a similar purpose.

TODO:
* Should the linter flag unnecessary scoping as well?
  For instance, should
  ```lean
  example : True := by
    · · exact .intro
  ```
  raise a warning?
* Custom support for "accumulating side-goals", so that once they are all in scope
  they can be solved in bulk via `all_goals` or a similar tactic.
* In development, `on_goal` has been partly used as a way of silencing the linter
  precisely to allow the accumulation referred to in the previous item.
  Maybe revisit usages of `on_goal` and also nested `induction` and `cases`.

/-- The `SyntaxNodeKind`s in `exclusions` correspond to tactics that the linter allows,
even though there are multiple active goals.
Reasons for admitting a kind in `exclusions` include
* the tactic focuses on one goal, e.g. `·`, `focus`, `on_goal i =>`, ...;
* the tactic is reordering the goals, e.g. `swap`, `rotate_left`, ...;
* the tactic is structuring a proof, e.g. `skip`, `<;>`, ...;
* the tactic is creating new goals, e.g. `constructor`, `cases`, `induction`, ....

There is some overlap in scope between `ignoreBranch` and `exclusions`.

Tactic combinators like `repeat` or `try` are a mix of both.

/-- The `SyntaxNodeKind`s in `ignoreBranch` correspond to tactics that disable the linter from
their first application until the corresponding proof branch is closed.
Reasons for ignoring these tactics include
* the linter gets confused by the proof management, e.g. `conv`;
* the tactics are *intended* to act on multiple goals, e.g. `repeat`, `any_goals`, `all_goals`, ...
