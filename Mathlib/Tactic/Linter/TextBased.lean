## Text-based linters

This file defines various mathlib linters which are based on reading the source code only.
In practice, all such linters check for code style issues.

For now, this only contains linters checking
- that the copyright header and authors line are correctly formatted
- existence of module docstrings (in the right place)
- for certain disallowed imports
- if the string "adaptation note" is used instead of the command #adaptation_note
- lines are at most 100 characters long (except for URLs)
- files are at most 1500 lines long (unless specifically allowed).
- unicode characters that aren't used in math or in Mathlib

For historic reasons, some of these checks are still written in a Python script `lint-style.py`:
these are gradually being rewritten in Lean.

This linter maintains a list of exceptions, for legacy reasons.
Ideally, the length of the list of exceptions tends to 0.

An executable running all these linters is defined in `scripts/lint-style.lean`.
