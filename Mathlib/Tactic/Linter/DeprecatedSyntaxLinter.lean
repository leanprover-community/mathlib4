# Linter against deprecated syntax

`refine'` and `cases'` provide backward-compatible implementations of their unprimed equivalents
in Lean 3, `refine` and `cases`. They have been superseded by Lean 4 tactics:

* `refine` and `apply` replace `refine'`. While they are similar, they handle metavariables
  slightly differently; this means that they are not completely interchangeable, nor can one
  completely replace another. However, `refine` and `apply` are more readable and (heuristically)
  tend to be more efficient on average.
* `obtain`, `rcases` and `cases` replace `cases'`. Unlike the replacement tactics, `cases'`
  does not require the variables it introduces to be separated by case, which hinders readability.

The `admit` tactic is a synonym for the much more common `sorry`, so the latter should be preferred.

This linter is an incentive to discourage uses of such deprecated syntax, without being a ban.
It is not inherently limited to tactics.
