# Checker for well-formed title and labels
This script checks if a PR title matches mathlib's commit conventions,
and if the PR has any contradictory labels.
Not all checks from the commit conventions are implemented: for instance, no effort is made to
verify whether the title or body are written in present imperative tense.

/-- Split a string in two, at a given position. Assumes `pos` is valid. -/
-- FIXME: this should be added to batteries, as a version of "splitOn"
def splitAtPos (s : String) (pos : String.Pos) : String × String :=
  let before := s.extract 0 pos
  let after := s.extract (s.next pos) s.endPos
  (before, after)

Check if `title` matches the mathlib conventions for PR titles
(documented at https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/commit.html).
Not all checks are implemented: for instance, no effort is made to verify if the title or body
are written in present imperative tense.
Return all error messages for violations found.
