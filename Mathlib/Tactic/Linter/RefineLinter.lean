# The "refine" linter

The "refine" linter flags usages of the `refine'` tactic.

The tactics `refine` and `refine'` are similar, but they handle meta-variables slightly differently.
This means that they are not completely interchangeable, nor can one completely replace the other.
However, `refine` is more readable and (heuristically) tends to be more efficient on average.

This linter is an incentive to discourage uses of `refine'`, without being a ban.
