#  The "flexible" linter

The "flexible" linter makes sure that a "rigid" tactic (such as `rw`) does not act on the
output of a "flexible" tactic (such as `simp`).

For example, this ensures that, if you want to use `simp [...]` in the middle of a proof,
then you should replace `simp [...]` by one of
* a `suffices \"expr after simp\" by simpa` line;
* the output of `simp? [...]`, so that the final code contains `simp only [...]`;
* something else that does not involve `simp`!

Otherwise, the linter will complain.

Simplifying and appealing to a geometric intuition, you can imagine a (tactic) proof like a
directed graph, where
* each node is a local hypothesis or a goal in some metavariable and
* two hypotheses/goals are connected by an arrow if there is a tactic that modifies the source
  of the arrow into the target (this does not apply well to all tactics, but it does apply to
  a large number of them).
With this in mind, a tactic like `rw [lemma]` takes a *very specific* input and return a
*very predictable* output.
Such a tactic is "rigid". Any tactic is rigid, unless it is in `flexible` or `stoppers`.
Conversely, a tactic like `simp` acts on a wide variety of inputs and returns an output that
is possibly unpredictable: if later modifications adds a `simp`-lemma or some internals of
`simp` changes, the output of `simp` may change as well.
Such a tactic is `flexible`. Other examples are `split`, `abel`, `norm_cast`,...
Let's go back to the graph picture above.
* ✅️ [`rigid` --> `flexible`]
  A sequence `rw [lemma]; simp` is unlikely to break, since `rw [lemma]` produces the same output
  unless some *really major* change happens!
* ❌️ [`flexible` --> `rigid`]
  A sequence `simp; rw [lemma]` is instead more likely to break, since the goal after `simp` is
  subject to change by even a small, likely, modification of the `simp` set.
* ✅️ [`flexible` --> `flexible`]
  A sequence `simp; linarith` is also quite stable, since if `linarith` was able to close the
  goal with a "weaker" `simp`, it will likely still be able to close the goal with a `simp`
  that takes one further step.
* ✅️ [`flexible` --> `stopper`]
  Finally, a sequence `simp; ring_nf` is stable and, moreover, the output of `ring_nf` is a
  "normal form", which means that it is likely to produce an unchanged result, even if the initial
  input is different from the proof in its initial form.
  A stopper can be followed by a rigid tactic, "stopping" the spread of the flexible reach.

What the linter does is keeping track of nodes that are connected by `flexible` tactics and
makes sure that only `flexible` or `stoppers` follow them.
Such nodes are `Stained`.
Whenever it reaches a `stopper` edge, the target node is no longer `Stained` and it is
available again to `rigid` tactics.

Currently, the only tactics that "start" the bookkeeping are most forms of non-`only` `simp`s.
These are encoded by the `flexible?` predicate.
Future modifications of the linter may increase the scope of the `flexible?` predicate and
forbid a wider range of combinations.

## TODO
The example
```lean
example (h : 0 = 0) : True := by
  simp at h
  assumption
```
should trigger the linter, since `assumption` uses `h` that has been "stained" by `simp at h`.
However, `assumption` contains no syntax information for the location `h`, so the linter in its
current form does not catch this.

## Implementation notes

A large part of the code is devoted to tracking `FVar`s and `MVar`s between tactics.

For the `FVar`s, this follows the following heuristic:
* if the unique name of the `FVar` is preserved, then we use that;
* otherwise, if the `userName` of the `FVar` is preserved, then we use that;
* if neither is preserved, we drop the ball and stop tracking the `FVarId`.

For the `MVar`s, we use the information of `Lean.Elab.TacticInfo.goalsBefore` and
`Lean.Elab.TacticInfo.goalsAfter`.
By looking at the `mvar`s that are either only "before" or only "after", we focus on the
"active" goals.
We then propagate all the `FVarId`s that were present in the "before" goals to the "after" goals,
while leaving untouched the ones in the "inert" goals.

###  Heuristics for determining goals goals that a tactic modifies what they become

The two definitions `goalsTargetedBy`, `goalsCreatedBy` extract a list of
`MVarId`s attempting to determine on which goals the tactic `t` is acting and what are the
resulting modified goals.
This is mostly based on the heuristic that the tactic will "change" an `MVarId`.
-/

/-- `goalsTargetedBy t` are the `MVarId`s before the `TacticInfo` `t` that "disappear" after it.
They should correspond to the goals in which the tactic `t` performs some action. -/
def goalsTargetedBy (t : TacticInfo) : List MVarId :=
  t.goalsBefore.filter (·.name ∉ t.goalsAfter.map (·.name))

/-- `goalsCreatedBy t` are the `MVarId`s after the `TacticInfo` `t` that were not present before.
They should correspond to the goals created or changed by the tactic `t`. -/
def goalsCreatedBy (t : TacticInfo) : List MVarId :=

`mvars` indicates the goal state:

 * the context after `stx`

 * a list of metavariables created by `stx`

A typical usage is to find the goals following a `simp` application.

`toStained stx` scans the input `Syntax` `stx` extracting identifiers and atoms, making an effort

The function is used to extract "location" information about `stx`: either explicit locations as in

Whether or not what this function extracts really is a location will be determined by the linter
using data embedded in the `InfoTree`s. -/

This means that tactics that do not have an explicit "`at`" in their syntax will be treated as

Tactics often change the name of the current `MVarId`, as well as the names of the `FVarId`s
appearing in their local contexts.
The function `reallyPersist` makes an attempt at "tracking" pairs `(fvar, mvar)` across a
simultaneous change represented by an "old" list of `MVarId`s and the corresponding
`MetavarContext` and a new one.

This arises in the context of the information encoded in the `InfoTree`s when processing a
tactic proof.
