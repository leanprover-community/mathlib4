#  The "commandRanges" linter

The "commandRanges" linter simply logs the `getRange?` and the `getRangeWithTrailing?`
for each command.

This is useful for the "removeDeprecations" automation, since it helps identifying the exact range
of each declaration that should be removed.

This linter is strictly tied to the `#clear_deprecations` command in
`Mathlib/Tactic/Linter/FindDeprecations.lean`.

/--
The "commandRanges" linter logs the `getRange?` and the `getRangeWithTrailing?` for each command.
The format is `[start, end, trailing]`, where
* `start` is the start of the command,
* `end` is the end of the command, not including trailing whitespace and comments,
* `trailing` is the "syntactic end" of the command, so it contains all trailing whitespace and
  comments.

Thus, assuming that there has been no tampering with positions/synthetic syntax,
if the current command is followed by another command, then `trailing` for the previous command
coincides with `start` of the following.
