# Linters for Unused Instances in Types

This file declares linters which detect certain instance hypotheses in declarations that are unused
in the remainder of the type.

Currently, these linters only handle theorems. (This also includes `lemma`s and `instance`s of
`Prop` classes.)

- `unusedDecidableInType` linter (currently off by default): suggests replacing type-unused
  `Decidable*` instance hypotheses, and could therefore be replaced by `classical` in the proof.

TODO: log on type signature instead of whole command
TODO: add more linters!
TODO: create Try This suggestions

namespace Mathlib.Linter.UnusedInstancesInType

/--
A structure for storing information about a parameter of some declaration, usually within some
telescope. We use this for recording the expressions and index associated to a parameter which was
unused in the remainder of the type.

`m!"{param}"` displays as `[{param.type?.get}] (#{param.idx + 1})` if `type?` is `some _`, and as
`parameter #{param.idx + 1}` as a failsafe if `type?` is `none`. (We always expect `type?` to be
`some _`, but would like a fallback if there are unexpected issues in telescoping.)

Given a (full, resolvable) declaration name `foo` and an array of parameters
`#[p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ]`, constructs the message:
```null

  • {p₁}
  • {p₂}

where the bracketed "outside of proofs" is only included if some parameter appears in a proof in
the type.

Gets the indices `i` (in ascending order) of the binders of a nested `.forallE`,
`(x₀ : A₀) → (x₁ : A₁) → ⋯ → X`, such that
- the binder `[xᵢ : Aᵢ]` has `instImplicit` `binderInfo`
-  `p Aᵢ` is `true`
- The rest of the type `(xᵢ₊₁ : Aᵢ₊₁) → ⋯ → X` does not depend on `xᵢ` outside of proofs.

This is like `getForallUnusedInstanceBinderIdxsWhere`, but ignores dependence that arises from
within proof terms.

The indices start at 0, and do not count `let`s.

  By instantiating ordinary binders with `sorry`, `collectFVarsOutsideOfProofs` can use the
  computed field accessed by `hasFVar` (in constant time) to avoid traversing any subexpressions
  that do not contain a free variable for an instance of concern, which helps performance.

Gathers instance hypotheses in the type of `decl` that are unused in the remainder of the type and
whose types satisfy `p`. (Does not consider the body of the declaration.) Collects them into an
`Array Parameter`, and if (and only if) this array is nonempty, feeds it to `logOnUnused`.

Since `logOnUnused` will only be run if its argument is nonempty, it is allowed to be expensive.

Note that `p` is non-monadic, and may encounter loose bvars in its argument. This is a performance
optimization. However, the `Parameter`s are created in a telescope, and their fields will *not*
have loose bound variables.

/--
Finds theorems whose bodies were elaborated in the current infotrees and whose (full)
declaration names satisfy `nameFilter`. Checks their type to see if it contains instance hypotheses
that (1) are unused in the remainder of the type (2) have types which satisfy `instanceTypeFilter`.
(Note: `instanceTypeFilter` is non-monadic, and may encounter bound variables in its argument. This
is a performance optimization. `isAppOrForallOfConstP` may be useful in detecting constant
applications and types of the form `∀ (...), bar ..` here.)

If any such parameters are found in the type of a theorem `foo`, we create a telescope in which the
types and free variables of the unused parameters are available as
`unusedParams : Array Parameter := #[p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ]`, as well as the theorem `thm : ConstantVal`
and current infotree `t`, and run `log t thm unusedParams`.

A simple pattern is therefore
```
fun _ thm unusedParams => do
  logLint linter.fooLinter (← getRef) m!"\
    {thm.name.unusedInstancesMsg unusedParams}\n\n\
    <extra caption>"
```
which logs
```null
`{foo}` has the hypothes(is/es):
  • {p₁}
  • {p₂}
  ⋮
  • {pₙ}
which (is/are) not used in the remainder of the type.

<extra caption>

Note: This linter can be disabled with `set_option {linter.fooLinter.name} false`
```
pluralizing as appropriate.

section Decidable

/--
Checks if `type` is an application of (or forall with return type which is an application of) a
`Decidable*` constant. Specifically, checks if the constant is one of:
- `Decidable`
- `DecidablePred`
- `DecidableRel`
- `DecidableEq`
- `DecidableLE`
- `DecidableLT`

Ignores metadata and cleans up annotations.

/--
The `unusedDecidableInType` linter checks if a theorem's hypotheses include `Decidable*` instances
which are not used in the remainder of the type. If so, it suggests removing the instances and using
`classical` or `open scoped Classical in`, as appropriate, in the theorem's proof instead.

This linter fires only on theorems. (This includes `lemma`s and `instance`s of `Prop` classes.)

Note: `set_option linter.unusedDecidableInType _ in <command>` currently only works at the
outermost level of a command due to working around [lean4#11313](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/11313).
