# Fail if no progress

This implements the `fail_if_no_progress` tactic, which fails if no actual progress is made by the
following tactic sequence.

"Actual progress" means that either the number of goals has changed, that the
number or presence of expressions in the context has changed, or that the type of some expression
in the context or the type of the goal is no longer definitionally equal to what it used to be at
reducible transparency.

This means that, for example, `1 - 1` changing to `0` does not count as actual progress, since
```lean
example : (1 - 1 = 0) := by with_reducible rfl
```

This tactic is useful in situations where we want to stop iterating some tactics if they're not
having any effect, e.g. `repeat (fail_if_no_progress simp <;> ring_nf)`.
