# `nth_rewrite` tactic

The tactic `nth_rewrite` and `nth_rw` are variants of `rewrite` and `rw` that only performs the
`n`th possible rewrite.

/-- `nth_rewrite` is a variant of `rewrite` that only changes the nth occurrence of the expression
to be rewritten.

Note: The occurrences are counted beginning with `1` and not `0`, this is different than in
mathlib3. The translation will be handled by mathport. -/

`nth_rw` is like `nth_rewrite`, but also tries to close the goal by trying `rfl` afterwards.
