# `qify` tactic

The `qify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `ℕ` or `ℤ` to `ℚ`.
This is often useful since `ℚ` has well-behaved division.
```
example (a b c x y z : ℕ) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
  qify
  qify at h
  /-
  h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
  ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b

`qify` rewrites the main goal by shifting propositions from `ℕ` or `ℤ` to `ℚ`.
This is often useful since `ℚ` has well-behaved subtraction and division.

`qify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` and `@[qify_simps]` attributes to insert casts into
propositions, and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℚ`-valued expressions.

`qify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic. `lift (q : ℚ) to ℤ` will change the type of a
rational number `q` (in the supertype) to `ℤ` (the subtype), given a proof that `q.den = 1`;
propositions concerning `q` will still be over `ℚ`. `qify` changes propositions about `ℕ` or `ℤ`
(the subtype) to propositions about `ℚ` (the supertype), without changing the type of any variable.

* `qify at l1 l2 ...` rewrites at the given locations.
* `qify [h₁, ..., hₙ]` uses the expressions `h₁`, ..., `hₙ` as extra lemmas for simplification.
  This is especially useful in the presence of nat subtraction or of division: passing arguments of
  type `· ≤ ·` or `· ∣ ·` will allow `push_cast` to do more work.

Examples:
```
example (a b c x y z : ℕ) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
  qify
  qify at h
  /-
  h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
  ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b

example (a b c : ℤ) (h : a / b = c) (hab : b ∣ a) (hb : b ≠ 0) : a = c * b := by
  -- Divisibility hypothesis allows pushing `· / ·`.
  qify [hab] at h hb ⊢
  exact (div_eq_iff hb).1 h
