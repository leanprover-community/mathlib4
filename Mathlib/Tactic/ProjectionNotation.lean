# Commands for configuring projection notation

This module contains some relatively simple commands that can be used
to configure functions to pretty print with projection
notation (i.e., like `x.f y` rather than `C.f x y`).

One of these commands is for collapsing chains of ancestor projections.
For example, to turn `x.toFoo.toBar` into `x.toBar`.

Defines an `app_unexpander` for the given function to support a basic form of projection
notation. It is *only* for functions whose first explicit argument is the receiver
of the generalized field notation. That is to say, it is only meant for transforming
`C.f c x y z ...` to `c.f x y z ...` for `c : C`.

It can be used to help get projection notation to work for function-valued structure fields,
since the default projection delaborator cannot handle excess arguments.

Example for generalized field notation:
```
structure A where
  n : Nat

def A.foo (a : A) (m : Nat) : Nat := a.n + m

pp_extended_field_notation A.foo
```
Now, `A.foo x m` pretty prints as `x.foo m`. It also adds a rule that
`A.foo x.toA m` pretty prints as `x.foo m`. This rule is meant to combine with
the projection collapse delaborator, so that `A.foo x.toB.toA m` also will
pretty print as `x.foo m`.

Since this last rule is a purely syntactic transformation,
it might lead to output that does not round trip, though this can only occur if
there exists an `A`-valued `toA` function that is not a parent projection that
happens to be pretty printable using dot notation.

Here is an example to illustrate the round tripping issue:
```lean
import Mathlib.Tactic.ProjectionNotation

structure A where n : Int

def A.inc (a : A) (k : Int) : Int := a.n + k

pp_extended_field_notation A.inc

structure B where n : Nat

def B.toA (b : B) : A := ⟨b.n⟩

variable (b : B)

#check A.inc b.toA 1
-- (B.toA b).inc 1 : Int

pp_extended_field_notation B.toA
#check A.inc b.toA 1
-- b.inc 1 : Int

#check b.inc 1
-- invalid field 'inc', the environment does not contain 'B.inc'
```
To avoid this, don't use `pp_extended_field_notation` for coercion functions
such as `B.toA`.
