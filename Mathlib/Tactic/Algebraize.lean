## Algebraize tactic

This file defines the `algebraize` tactic. The basic functionality of this tactic is to
automatically add `Algebra` instances given `RingHom`s. For example, `algebraize [f, g]` where
`f : A →+* B` and `g : B →+* C` are `RingHom`s, will add the instances `Algebra A B` and
`Algebra B C` corresponding to these `RingHom`s.

## Further functionality

When given a composition of `RingHom`s, e.g. `algebraize [g.comp f]`, the tactic will also try to
add the instance `IsScalarTower A B C` if possible.

After having added suitable `Algebra` and `IsScalarTower` instances, the tactic will search through
the local context for `RingHom` properties that can be converted to properties of the corresponding
`Algebra`. For example, given `f : A →+* B` and `hf : f.FiniteType`, then `algebraize [f]` will add
the instance `Algebra A B` and the corresponding property `Algebra.FiniteType A B`. The tactic knows
which `RingHom` properties have a corresponding `Algebra` property through the `algebraize`
attribute.

## Algebraize attribute

The `algebraize` attribute is used to tag `RingHom` properties that can be converted to `Algebra`
properties. It assumes that the tagged declaration has a name of the form `RingHom.Property` and
that the corresponding `Algebra` property has the name `Algebra.Property`.

If not, the `Name` of the corresponding algebra property can be provided as optional argument. The
specified declaration should be one of the following:

1. An inductive type (i.e. the `Algebra` property itself), in this case it is assumed that the
`RingHom` and the `Algebra` property are definitionally the same, and the tactic will construct the
`Algebra` property by giving the `RingHom` property as a term. Due to how this is peformed, we also
need to assume that the `Algebra` property can be constructed only from the homomorphism, so it can
not have any other explicit arguments.
2. A lemma (or constructor) proving the `Algebra` property from the `RingHom` property. In this case
it is assumed that the `RingHom` property is the final argument, and that no other explicit argument
is needed. The tactic then constructs the `Algebra` property by applying the lemma or constructor.

Here are three examples of properties tagged with the `algebraize` attribute:
```
@[algebraize]
def RingHom.FiniteType (f : A →+* B) : Prop :=
  @Algebra.FiniteType A B _ _ f.toAlgebra
```
An example when the `Name` is provided (as the `Algebra` does not have the expected name):
```
@[algebraize Module.Finite]
def RingHom.Finite (f : A →+* B) : Prop :=
  letI : Algebra A B := f.toAlgebra
  Module.Finite A B
```
An example with a constructor as parameter (as the two properties are not definitonally the same):
```
@[algebraize Algebra.Flat.out]
class RingHom.Flat {R : Type u} {S : Type v} [CommRing R] [CommRing S] (f : R →+* S) : Prop where
  out : f.toAlgebra.Flat := by infer_instance
```

## algebraize_only

To avoid searching through the local context and adding corresponding `Algebra` properties, use
`algebraize_only` which only adds `Algebra` and `IsScalarTower` instances.

/-- A user attribute that is used to tag `RingHom` properties that can be converted to `Algebra`
properties. Using an (optional) parameter, it will also generate a `Name` of a declaration which
will help the `algebraize` tactic access the corresponding `Algebra` property.

There are two cases for what declaration corresponding to this `Name` can be.

1. An inductive type (i.e. the `Algebra` property itself), in this case it is assumed that the
`RingHom` and the `Algebra` property are definitionally the same, and the tactic will construct the
`Algebra` property by giving the `RingHom` property as a term.
2. A lemma (or constructor) proving the `Algebra` property from the `RingHom` property. In this case
it is assumed that the `RingHom` property is the final argument, and that no other explicit argument
is needed. The tactic then constructs the `Algebra` property by applying the lemma or constructor.

Finally, if no argument is provided to the `algebraize` attribute, it is assumed that the tagged
declaration has name `RingHom.Property` and that the corresponding `Algebra` property has name
`Algebra.Property`. The attribute then returns `Algebra.Property` (so assume case 1 above). -/

/-- Tactic that, given `RingHom`s, adds the corresponding `Algebra` and (if possible)
`IsScalarTower` instances, as well as `Algebra` corresponding to `RingHom` properties available
as hypotheses.

Example: given `f : A →+* B` and `g : B →+* C`, and `hf : f.FiniteType`, `algebraize [f, g]` will
add the instances `Algebra A B`, `Algebra B C`, and `Algebra.FiniteType A B`.

See the `algebraize` tag for instructions on what properties can be added.

The tactic also comes with a configuration option `properties`. If set to `true` (default), the
tactic searches through the local context for `RingHom` properties that can be converted to
`Algebra` properties. The macro `algebraize_only` calls
`algebraize (config := {properties := false})`,
so in other words it only adds `Algebra` and `IsScalarTower` instances. -/
