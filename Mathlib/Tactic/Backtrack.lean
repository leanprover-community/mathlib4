# `backtrack`

A meta-tactic for running backtracking search, given a non-deterministic tactic
`alternatives : MVarId → Nondet MetaM (List MVarId)`.

`backtrack alternatives goals` will recursively try to solve all goals in `goals`,
and the subgoals generated, backtracking as necessary.

In its default behaviour, it will either solve all goals, or fail.
A customisable `suspend` hook in `BacktrackConfig` allows suspend a goal (or subgoal),
so that it will be returned instead of processed further.
Other hooks `proc` and `discharge` (described in `BacktrackConfig`) allow running other
tactics before `alternatives`, or if all search branches from a given goal fail.

Currently only `solveByElim` is implemented in terms of `backtrack`.

Given any tactic that takes a goal, and returns a sequence of alternative outcomes
(each outcome consisting of a list of new subgoals),
we can perform backtracking search by repeatedly applying the tactic.

Configuration structure to control the behaviour of `backtrack`:
* control the maximum depth and behaviour (fail or return subgoals) at the maximum depth,
* and hooks allowing
  * modifying intermediate goals before running the external tactic,
  * 'suspending' goals, returning them in the result, and
  * discharging subgoals if the external tactic fails.

  Called as `proc goals curr`, where `goals` are the original goals for `backtracking`,
  and `curr` are the current goals.
  Returning `some l` will replace the current goals with `l` and recurse
  (consuming one step of maximum depth).
  Returning `none` will proceed to applying lemmas without changing goals.
  Failure will cause backtracking.

/--
Attempts to solve the `goals`, by recursively calling `alternatives g` on each subgoal that appears.
`alternatives` returns a nondeterministic list of goals
(this is essentially a lazy list of `List MVarId`,
with the extra state required to backtrack in `MetaM`).

`backtrack` performs a backtracking search, attempting to close all subgoals.

Further flow control options are available via the `Config` argument.
