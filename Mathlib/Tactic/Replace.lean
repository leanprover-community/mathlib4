syntax "replace " haveDecl : tactic

/--
Acts like `have`, but removes a hypothesis with the same name as
this one if possible. For example, if the state is:

```lean
f : α → β
h : α
⊢ goal
```

Then after `replace h := f h` the state will be:

```lean
f : α → β
h : β
⊢ goal
```

Where `have h := f h` would result in:

```lean
f : α → β
h† : α
h : β
⊢ goal
```

This can be used to simulate the `specialize` and `apply at` tactics of Coq.
