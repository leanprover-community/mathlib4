# Extending `replace`

This file extends the `replace` tactic from `Std` to allow the addition of hypotheses to
the context without requiring their proofs to be provided immediately.

As a style choice, this should not be used in mathlib; but is provided for downstream users who
preferred the old style.

Acts like `have`, but removes a hypothesis with the same name as
this one if possible. For example, if the state is:

Then after `replace h : β` the state will be:

```lean
case h
f : α → β
h : α
⊢ β

f : α → β
h : β
⊢ goal
```

whereas `have h : β` would result in:

```lean
case h
f : α → β
h : α
⊢ β

f : α → β
h✝ : α
h : β
⊢ goal
```
