# The `bound` attribute

Any lemma tagged with `@[bound]` is registered as an apply rule for the `bound` tactic, by
converting it to either `norm apply` or `safe apply <priority>`.  The classification is based
on the number and types of the lemma's hypotheses.

/-- Register a lemma as an `apply` rule for the `bound` tactic.

A lemma is appropriate for `bound` if it proves an inequality using structurally simpler
inequalities, "recursing" on the structure of the expressions involved, assuming positivity or
nonnegativity where useful. Examples include
1. `gcongr`-like inequalities over `<` and `≤` such as `f x ≤ f y` where `f` is monotone (note that
   `gcongr` supports other relations).
2. `mul_le_mul` which proves `a * b ≤ c * d` from `a ≤ c ∧ b ≤ d ∧ 0 ≤ b ∧ 0 ≤ c`
3. Positivity or nonnegativity inequalities such as `sub_nonneg`: `a ≤ b → 0 ≤ b - a`
4. Inequalities involving `1` such as `one_le_div` or `Real.one_le_exp`
5. Disjunctions where the natural recursion branches, such as `a ^ n ≤ a ^ m` when the inequality
   for `n,m` depends on whether `1 ≤ a ∨ a ≤ 1`.

Each `@[bound]` lemma is assigned a score based on the number and complexity of its hypotheses,
and the `aesop` implementation chooses lemmas with lower scores first:
1. Inequality hypotheses involving `0` add 1 to the score.
2. General inequalities add `10`.
3. Disjuctions `a ∨ b` add `100` plus the sum of the scores of `a` and `b`.

The functionality of `bound` overlaps with `positivity` and `gcongr`, but can jump back and forth
between `0 ≤ x` and `x ≤ y`-type inequalities.  For example, `bound` proves
  `0 ≤ c → b ≤ a → 0 ≤ a * c - b * c`
by turning the goal into `b * c ≤ a * c`, then using `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`.  `bound` also
uses specialized lemmas for goals of the form `1 ≤ x, 1 < x, x ≤ 1, x < 1`.

See also `@[bound_forward]` which marks a lemma as a forward rule for `bound`: these lemmas are
applied to hypotheses to extract inequalities (e.g. `HasPowerSeriesOnBall.r_pos`). -/

/-- Attribute for `forward` rules for the `bound` tactic.

`@[bound_forward]` lemmas should produce inequalities given other hypotheses that might be in the
context. A typical example is exposing an inequality field of a structure, such as
`HasPowerSeriesOnBall.r_pos`. -/
