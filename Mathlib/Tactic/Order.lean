# `order` tactic

This module defines the `order` tactic, a decision procedure for the theories of `Preorder`,
`PartialOrder`, `LinearOrder`, and `Lattice`. It also supports `⊤` and `⊥`.

## Implementation Details

Below, we describe the algorithm for each type of order. All algorithms begin with two steps:
1. Negate the goal so that our goal now is to derive `False`.
2. Collect the set of *facts*, i.e., atomic expressions in one of six forms: `x = y`, `x ≠ y`,
`x ≤ y`, `¬(x ≤ y)`, `x < y`, and `¬(x < y)`. We then attempt to derive a contradiction from this
set of facts.

### Preorder
3. **Preprocessing**.
We replace some facts as follows:
* Replace `x < y` with two equivalent facts: `x ≤ y` and `¬(y ≤ x)`.
* Replace `x = y` with `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ x`.
* Remove `x ≠ y`.
Note that the last two operations weaken the set of facts.
4. **Building the `≤`-graph**.
We construct a graph where vertices correspond to atoms, and an edge `(x, y)` exists if the fact
`x ≤ y` is present in our set of facts. We call this graph a `≤`-graph.
5. **Growing the `≤`-graph with `≮`-facts**.
In preorders, `¬(x < y)` is equivalent to `(x ≤ y) → (y ≤ x)`. Thus, if `y` is reachable from `x`
in the `≤`-graph, we can derive the new fact `y ≤ x`. At this step, we add such edges to the graph
while possible.
6. **Finding contradictions using `≰`-facts**.
For each fact `¬(x ≤ y)`, we check if `y` is reachable from `x` in the `≤`-graph. If so, we derive
the desired contradiction.

#### Why is this a decision procedure?
Technically, it is not, because it cannot prove `(x = y) → (y ≠ z) → (x ≠ z)`. Goals involving
only `=` and `≠` can be handled by the `cc` tactic. Assume, then, that a set `T` of facts is
contradictory, but there is no chain `x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₖ` in `T` along with the fact `x₁ ≠ xₖ`. Then
we claim that the described algorithm is able to deduce a contradiction from `T`. Let `T'` be the
set of facts after preprocessing. Then `T'` remains contradictory.

Indeed, suppose that `T'` is satisfiable, i.e., there exists a model `M` that satisfies `T'`.
Consider a quotient `M'` of `M` by the equivalence relation `~`, where `a ~ b` holds for `a ≠ b` iff
both `a` and `b` are values of some variables `x` and `y` from `T`, and there is
a chain `x = ... = y` in `T`. Define the relation `R'` on `M'` as `α R' β` if and only if `a R b`
in `M` for some `a ∈ α` and `b ∈ β`. Then `M'` is a model satisfying `T`:
* For any fact `x = y` in `T`, we have `M'(x) = M'(y)` in `M'`.
* For any fact `x ≠ y` in `T`, we have `M'(x) ≠ M'(y)`, since otherwise, there would exist
  a chain `x = ... = y` in `T`.
* For any fact `x ≤ y` in `T`, and thus in `T'`, we have `M(x) R M(y)`, so `M'(x) R' M'(y)`.
* For any fact `¬(x ≤ y)` in `T`, and thus in `T'`, we have `¬M(x) R M(y)`. Then, for any `x' ~ x`
  and `y' ~ y`, we can deduce `x ≤ x'` and `y' ≤ y` from `T'`. If `M(x') R M(y')`, then
  `M(x) R M(x') R M(y') R M(y)`, which contradicts the assumption that `M` is a model of `T'`.
  This contradiction implies that `¬M'(x) R' M'(y)`, as required.

If, at step 6, no contradictory `≰`-facts were found, we must show that a model satisfies `T'`.
A suitable model can be constructed using the connected components of the `=`-graph (defined
similarly to the `≤`-graph),
with the relation `R` defined as `C₁ R C₂` iff `C₂` is reachable from `C₁` in the `≤`-graph. Each
variable `x` is interpreted as its component `[x]`. This forms a preorder, and we verify that each
fact in `T'` is satisfied:
* `x = y` is satisfied because `x` and `y` must be in the same component in the `=`-graph.
* `x ≤ y` is satisfied by the construction of the `≤`-graph.
* `x ≠ y` is satisfied because otherwise, `x` and `y` would belong to the same component in
  the `=`-graph, contradicting our initial assumption.
* `¬(x < y)` is satisfied because otherwise `¬[y] R [x]`, meaning there is a path from `x` to `y`,
  which would have caused an edge `(y, x)` to be added at step 5, leading to a contradiction.

### Partial Order
3. **Preprocessing**.
We replace some facts as follows:
* Replace `x < y` with `x ≤ y` and `x ≠ y`.
* Replace `x = y` with `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ x`.
* Replace `¬(x ≤ y)` with `x ≠ y` and `¬(x < y)`.
4. **Building the `≤`-graph**: Same as for preorders.
5. **Growing the `≤`-graph with `≮`-facts**: Same as for preorders.
6. **Finding contradictions using `≠`-facts**.
We identify strongly connected components in the `≤`-graph using a standard algorithm. For each
fact `x ≠ y`, we check whether `x` and `y` belong to the same component. If they do, then `x = y` is
provable, contradicting `x ≠ y`.

#### Why is this a decision procedure?
Assume that a set `T` of facts is contradictory. We must show that the described algorithm can
derive a contradiction. Let `T'` be the set of facts after preprocessing. By construction, `T'` is
also contradictory (they are equisatisfiable). If, at step 6, no contradictory `≠`-facts were found,
we must show that a model satisfies `T'`. A suitable model consists of the strongly connected
components of the `≤`-graph, with the relation `R` defined as `C₁ R C₂` iff `C₂` is reachable
from `C₁`. Each variable `x` is interpreted as its component `[x]`. This forms a partial order, and
we verify that each fact in `T'` is satisfied:
* `x ≤ y` is satisfied because it directly implies `[x] R [y]`.
* `x ≠ y` is satisfied because otherwise, `x` and `y` would belong to the same component, leading to
  a contradiction at step 6.
* `¬(x < y)` is satisfied because otherwise `[x] ≠ [y]` and there is a path from `x` to `y`, which
  would have merged them into the same component at step 5.

### Linear Order
3. **Preprocessing**.
We replace some facts as follows:
* Replace `x < y` with `x ≤ y` and `x ≠ y`.
* Replace `x = y` with `x ≤ y` and `y ≤ x`.
* Replace `¬(x ≤ y)` with `x ≠ y` and `y ≤ x`.
* Replace `¬(x < y)` with `y ≤ x`.
4. **Building the `≤`-graph**: Same as for preorders.
5. **Finding contradictions using `≠`-facts**: Same as for partial orders.

Note that the algorithm for linear orders is simply the algorithm for partial orders with an
additional preprocessing step. It also skips the growing step because there is no `≮`-facts.

#### Why is this a decision procedure?
We need to slightly modify the proof for partial orders. In this case, `T` and `T'` are again
equisatisfiable. Suppose the algorithm cannot find a contradiction, and construct the model of `T'`.
The carrier of the model is once again the set of strongly connected components in the `≤`-graph,
with variables interpreted as their respective components. Note that the reachability relation
(used before) on components is acyclic. Therefore, it can be
[topologically ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), meaning it forms a
linear order where `C₁ R C₂` whenever `C₂` is reachable from `C₁`. It is easy to see that all facts
in `T'` are satisfied by the model.

### Lattice
The algorithm for lattices is similar to that for partial orders, with two differences:
1. During the preprocessing step, we add the facts `x ≤ x ⊔ y` and `y ≤ x ⊔ y` if `x ⊔ y` is present
in the context, and similarly for `⊓`.
2. In step 5, we expand the `≤`-graph using the following procedure: if a vertex `v` is reachable
from both `x` and `y`, and `x ⊔ y` is present in the set of atoms, we add the edge `(x ⊔ y, v)`
using `sup_le`, and similarly for `⊓`.

One can show that this algorithm also serves as a decision procedure for the theory of lattices.

### `⊤` and `⊥`
For `⊤` and `⊥`, we add the edges `(x, ⊤)` and `(⊥, x)` for all vertices `x`, using `le_top`
and `bot_le`, respectively.
