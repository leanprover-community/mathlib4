/-! # Monotonicity tactic

The tactic `mono` applies monotonicity rules (collected through the library by being tagged
`@[mono]`).

The version of the tactic here is a cheap partial port of the `mono` tactic from Lean 3, which had
many more options and features.  It is implemented as a wrapper on top of `solve_by_elim`.

Temporary syntax change: Lean 3 `mono` applied a single monotonicity rule, then applied local
hypotheses and the `rfl` tactic as many times as it could.  This is hard to implement on top of
`solve_by_elim` because the counting system used in the `maxDepth` field of its configuration would
count these as separate steps, throwing off the count in the desired configuration
`maxDepth := 1`.  So instead we just implement a version of `mono` in which monotonicity rules,
local hypotheses and `rfl` are all applied repeatedly until nothing more is applicable.  The syntax
for this in Lean 3 was `mono*`. Both `mono` and `mono*` implement this behavior for now.

`mono` applies monotonicity rules and local hypotheses repetitively.  For example,
```lean
example (x y z k : ℤ)
    (h : 3 ≤ (4 : ℤ))
    (h' : z ≤ y) :
    (k + 3 + x) - y ≤ (k + 4 + x) - z := by
  mono
```
