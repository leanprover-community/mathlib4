#  `move_add` a tactic for moving summands in expressions

The tactic `move_add` rearranges summands in expressions.

The tactic takes as input a list of terms, each one optionally preceded by `←`.
A term preceded by `←` gets moved to the left, while a term without `←` gets moved to the right.

* Empty input: `move_add []`

  In this case, the effect of `move_add []` is equivalent to `simp only [← add_assoc]`:
  essentially the tactic removes all visible parentheses.

* Singleton input: `move_add [a]` and `move_add [← a]`

  If `⊢ b + a + c` is (a summand in) the goal, then
  * `move_add [← a]` changes the goal to `a + b + c` (effectively, `a` moved to the left).
  * `move_add [a]` changes the goal to `b + c + a` (effectively, `a` moved to the right);

  The tactic reorders *all* sub-expressions of the target at the same same.
  For instance, if `⊢ 0 < if b + a < b + a + c then a + b else b + a` is the goal, then
  * `move_add [a]` changes the goal to `0 < if b + a < b + c + a then b + a else b + a`
    (`a` moved to the right in three sums);
  * `move_add [← a]` changes the goal to `0 < if a + b < a + b + c then a + b else a + b`
    (`a` again moved to the left in three sums).

* Longer inputs: `move_add [..., a, ..., ← b, ...]`

  If the list contains more than one term, the tactic effectively tries to move each term preceded
  by `←` to the left, each term not preceded by `←` to the right
  *maintaining the relative order in the call*.
  Thus, applying `move_add [a, b, c, ← d, ← e]` returns summands of the form
  `d + e + [...] + a + b + c`, i.e. `d` and `e` have the same relative position in the input list
  and in the final rearrangement (and similarly for `a, b, c`).
  In particular, `move_add [a, b]` likely has the same effect as
  `move_add [a]; move_add [b]`: first, we move `a` to the right, then we move `b` also to the
  right, *after* `a`.
  However, if the terms matched by `a` and `b` do not overlap, then `move_add [← a, ← b]`
  has the same effect as `move_add [b]; move_add [a]`:
  first, we move `b` to the left, then we move `a` also to the left, *before* `a`.
  The behaviour in the situation where `a` and `b` overlap is unspecified: `move_add`
  will descend into subexpressions, but the order in which they are visited depends
  on which rearrangements have already happened.
  Also note, though, that `move_add [a, b]` may differ `move_add [a]; move_add [b]`,
  for instance when `a` and `b` are `DefEq`.

* Unification of inputs and repetitions: `move_add [_, ← _, a * _]`

  The matching of the user inputs with the atoms of the summands in the target expression
  is performed via checking `DefEq` and selecting the first, still available match.
  Thus, if a sum in the target is `2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) + 4 * 7 + 10 * 10`, then
  `move_add [4 * _]` moves the summand `4 * (5 + 6)` to the right.

  The unification of later terms only uses the atoms in the target that have not yet been unified.
  Thus, if again the target contains `2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) + 4 * 7 + 10 * 10`, then
  `move_add [_, ← _, 4 * _]`
  matches
  * the first input (`_`) with `2 * 3`;
  * the second input (`_`) with `4 * (5 + 6)`;
  * the third input (`4 * _`) with `4 * 7`.

  The resulting permutation therefore places `2 * 3` and `4 * 7` to the left (in this order) and
  `4 * (5 + 6)` to the right: `2 * 3 + 4 * 7 + 10 * 10 + 4 * (5 + 6)`.

For the technical description, look at `Mathlib.MoveAdd.weight` and `Mathlib.MoveAdd.reorderUsing`.

`move_add` is the specialization of a more general `move_oper` tactic that takes a binary,
associative, commutative operation and a list of "operand atoms" and rearranges the operation.

## Extension notes

To work with a general associative, commutative binary operation, `move_oper`
needs to have inbuilt the lemmas asserting the analogues of
`add_comm, add_assoc, add_left_comm` for the new operation.
Currently, `move_oper` supports `HAdd.hAdd`, `HAdd.hAdd`, `and`, `or`, `max`, `min`.

These lemmas should be added to `Mathlib.MoveAdd.move_oper_simpCtx`.

## Implementation notes

The main driver behind the tactic is `Mathlib.MoveAdd.reorderAndSimp`.

The tactic takes the target, replaces the maximal subexpressions whose head symbol is the given
operation and replaces them by their reordered versions.
Once that is done, it tries to replace the initial goal with the permuted one by using `simp`.

Currently, no attempt is made at guiding `simp` by doing a `congr`-like destruction of the goal.
This will be the content of a later PR.

##  Reordering the variables

This section produces the permutations of the variables for `move_add`.

The user controls the final order by passing a list of terms to the tactic.
Each term can be preceded by `←` or not.
In the final ordering,
* terms preceded by `←` appear first,
* terms not preceded by `←` appear last,
* all remaining terms remain in their current relative order.

The two lists `L` and `L'.map Prod.fst` coincide.
The second component of each entry `(a, n)` in `L'` is the number of times that `a` appears in `L`
before the current location.

The resulting list of pairs has no duplicates.

/-- Return a sorting key so that all `(a, true)`s are in the list's order
and sorted before all `(a, false)`s, which are also in the list's order.
Although `weight` does not require this, we use `weight` in the case where the list obtained
from `L` by only keeping the first component (i.e. `L.map Prod.fst`) has no duplicates.
The properties that we mention here assume that this is the case.

Thus, `weight L` is a function `α → ℤ` with the following properties:
* if `(a, true)  ∈ L`, then `weight L a` is strictly negative;
* if `(a, false) ∈ L`, then `weight L a` is strictly positive;
* if neither `(a, true)` nor `(a, false)` is in `L`, then `weight L a = 0`.

Moreover, the function `weight L` is strictly monotone increasing on both
`{a : α | (a, true) ∈ L}` and `{a : α | (a, false) ∈ L}`,
in the sense that if `a' = (a, true)` and `b' = (b, true)` are in `L`,
then `a'` appears before `b'` in `L` if and only if `weight L a < weight L b` and
similarly for the pairs with second coordinate equal to `false`.

/-- `reorderUsing toReorder instructions` produces a reordering of `toReorder : List α`,
following the requirements imposed by `instructions : List (α × Bool)`.

These are the requirements:
* elements of `toReorder` that appear with `true` in `instructions` appear at the
  *beginning* of the reordered list, in the order in which they appear in `instructions`;
* similarly, elements of `toReorder` that appear with `false` in `instructions` appear at the
  *end* of the reordered list, in the order in which they appear in `instructions`;
* finally, elements of `toReorder` that do not appear in `instructions` appear "in the middle"
  with the order that they had in `toReorder`.

For example,
* `reorderUsing [0, 1, 2] [(0, false)] = [1, 2, 0]`,
* `reorderUsing [0, 1, 2] [(1, true)] = [1, 0, 2]`,
* `reorderUsing [0, 1, 2] [(1, true), (0, false)] = [1, 2, 0]`.

except for the last two.
This is similar to `Lean.Meta.mkAdd, Lean.Meta.mkMul`, except that the resulting operation is

This is useful to rearrange the operands.

(i.e. the maximal subexpressions that consist only of applications of the binary operation `op`),
it rearranges the operands of such subexpressions following the order implied by `instructions`
(as in `reorderUsing`),
it returns the list of pairs of expressions `(old_sum, new_sum)`, for which `old_sum ≠ new_sum`

/-- `pairUp L R` takes to lists `L R : List Expr` as inputs.
It scans the elements of `L`, looking for a corresponding `DefEq` `Expr`ession in `R`.
If it finds one such element `d`, then it sets the element `d : R` aside, removing it from `R`, and
it continues with the matching on the remainder of `L` and on `R.erase d`.

At the end, it returns the sublist of `R` of the elements that were matched to some element of `R`,
in the order in which they appeared in `L`,
as well as the sublist of `L` of elements that were not matched, also in the order in which they
appeared in `L`.

Example:
```lean

  let L := [mkNatLit 0, (← mkFreshExprMVar (some (mkConst ``Nat))), mkNatLit 0] -- i.e. [0, _, 0]
  let R := [mkNatLit 0, mkNatLit 0,                                 mkNatLit 1] -- i.e. [0, 1]
  dbg_trace f!"{(← pairUp L R)}"
/- output:
`([0, 0], [0])`
the output LHS list `[0, 0]` consists of the first `0` and the `MVarId`.
the output RHS list `[0]` corresponds to the last `0` in `L`.
