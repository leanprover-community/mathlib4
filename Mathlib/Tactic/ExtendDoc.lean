#  `extend_doc` command

In a file where declaration `decl` is defined, writing
```lean
extend_doc decl
  before "I will be added as a prefix to the docs of `decl`"
  after "I will be added as a suffix to the docs of `decl`"
```

does what is probably clear: it extends the doc-string of `decl` by adding the string of
`before` at the beginning and the string of `after` at the end.

At least one of `before` and `after` must appear, but either one of them is optional.
