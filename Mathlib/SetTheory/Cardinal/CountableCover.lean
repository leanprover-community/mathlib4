# Cardinality of a set with a countable cover

Assume that a set `t` is eventually covered by a countable family of sets, all with
cardinality `≤ a`. Then `t` itself has cardinality at most `a`. This is proved in
`Cardinal.mk_subtype_le_of_countable_eventually_mem`.

Versions are also given when `t = univ`, and with `= a` instead of `≤ a`.
