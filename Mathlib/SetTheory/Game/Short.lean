# Short games

A combinatorial game is `Short` [Conway, ch.9][conway2001] if it has only finitely many positions.
In particular, this means there is a finite set of moves at every point.

We prove that the order relations `≤` and `<`, and the equivalence relation `≈`, are decidable on
short games, although unfortunately in practice `decide` doesn't seem to be able to
prove anything using these instances.
