/--
Finds the first result of `← f ctx info children` which is `some a`, descending the
tree from the top. Merges and updates contexts as it descends the tree.

`f` is **only** evaluated on nodes when some context is present. An initial context should be
provided via the `ctx?` argument if invoking `findSomeM?` during a larger traversal of the
infotree. A failure to provide `ctx? := some ctx` when `t` is not the outermost `InfoTree` is thus
likely to cause `findSomeM?` to always return `none`.

/--
Returns the value of `f ctx info children` on the outermost `.node info children` which has
context, having merged and updated contexts appropriately.

If `ctx?` is `some ctx`, `ctx` is used as an initial context. A `ctx?` of `none` should **only** be
used when operating on the first node of the entire infotree. Otherwise, it is likely that no
context will be found.

/--
Get the `parentDecl`s of every elaborated body.

This includes `let rec`/`where` definitions, but excludes decls without "bodies" (such as
`alias`es, `structure`s, declarations generated by attributes like `@[ext]`, and so on) as we
might find by considering every `parentDeclCtx` throughout the infotree.

Assumes that every body elaboration proceeds through `Lean.Elab.Term.BodyInfo`.

          decl :: decls
        else decls
      else decls
    | _ => decls

/--
Get the declarations elaborated in the infotree `t` which are theorems according to the
environment. This includes e.g. `instance`s of `Prop` classes in addition to declarations declared
using the keyword `theorem` directly.

def getTheorems (t : InfoTree) (env : Environment) : List ConstantVal :=
