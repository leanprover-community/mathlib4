# Additional utilities for `Lean.Environment`

Including operations on `ConstantVal`, `ConstantKind`, `ConstantInfo`.

namespace Lean.Environment

/- The following declarations account for the fact that the `ConstantKind` of a declaration is
accessible when getting its `ConstantVal`, but is not recorded in said `ConstantVal`. -/

/--
Like `findConstVal?`, but also returns the declarations `ConstantKind`, which is known immediately.

Blocks on everything but the constant's body (if any), which is not accessible through the result.
-/
def findConstValWithKind? (env : Environment) (decl : Name) (skipRealize := false) :
    Option (ConstantVal × ConstantKind) := do
  let info ← env.findAsync? decl skipRealize
  return (info.toConstantVal, info.kind)

/--
Like `findConstVal?`, but only finds the `ConstantVal` for `decl` in `env` if its kind satisfies
`p`. Otherwise, returns `none`.

Blocks on everything but the constant's body (if any), which is not accessible through the result.
-/
def findConstValOfKind? (env : Environment) (p : ConstantKind → Bool) (decl : Name)
    (skipRealize := false) : Option ConstantVal := do
  let info ← env.findAsync? decl skipRealize
  if p info.kind then info.toConstantVal else none

/--
Like `findConstVal?`, but only finds the `ConstantVal` for `decl` in `env` if it is a theorem.

Blocks on everything but the constant's body (if any), which is not accessible through the result.
-/
def findTheoremConstVal? (env : Environment) (decl : Name)
    (skipRealize := false) : Option ConstantVal := do
  env.findConstValOfKind? (· matches .thm) decl skipRealize

/--
Checks whether the environment contains `decl` publicly, or privately in the current module.
Returns the `ConstantInfo` with that name.
Note: `env` must be obtained wrapped inside `withoutExporting` for it to be able to see
private declarations.

def findPublicOrPrivate? (env : Environment) (decl : Name) : Option ConstantInfo :=
  env.find? decl <|>
  env.find? (if isPrivateName decl then privateToUserName decl else mkPrivateName env decl)
