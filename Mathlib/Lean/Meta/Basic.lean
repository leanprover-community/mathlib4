This function is similar to `forallMetaTelescopeReducing`: Given `e` of the
form `forall ..xs, A`, this combinator will create a new metavariable for
each `x` in `xs` until it reaches an `x` whose type is defeq to `t`,
and instantiate `A` with these, while also reducing `A` if needed.
It uses `forallMetaTelescopeReducing`.

This function returns a triple `(mvs, bis, out)` where
- `mvs` is an array containing the new metavariables.
- `bis` is an array containing the binder infos for the `mvs`.
- `out` is `e` but instantiated with the `mvs`.
