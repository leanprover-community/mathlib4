/-!
This is the root file in Mathlib: it is imported by virtually *all* Mathlib files.
For this reason, the imports of this files are carefully curated.
Any modification involving a change in the imports of this file should be discussed beforehand.

Here are some general guidelines:
* no bucket imports (e.g. `Batteries`/`Lean`/etc);
* every import needs to have a comment explaining why the import is there;
* strong preference for avoiding files that themselves have imports beyond `Lean`, and
  any exception to this rule should by accompanied by a comment explaining the transitive imports.

A linter verifies that every file in Mathlib imports `Mathlib.Init`
(perhaps indirectly) --- except for the imports in this file, of course.

## Linters

All syntax linters defined in Mathlib which are active by default are imported here.
Syntax linters need to be imported to take effect, hence we would like them to be imported
as early as possible.

All linters imported here have no bulk imports;
**Not** imported in this file are
- the text-based linters in `Linters/TextBased.lean`, as they can be imported later
- the `haveLet` linter, as it is currently disabled by default due to crashes
- the `ppRoundTrip` linter, which is current disabled (as this is not mature enough)
- the `minImports` linter, as that linter is disabled by default (and has an informational function;
  it is useful for debugging, but not as a permanently enabled lint)
- the `upstreamableDecls` linter, as it is also mostly informational

-/

/-- Define a linter set of all mathlib syntax linters which are enabled by default.

Projects depending on mathlib can use `set_option linter.allMathlibLinters true` to enable
all these linters, or add the `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet` option to their lakefile.
