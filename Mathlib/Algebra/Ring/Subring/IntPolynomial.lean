# Polynomials over subrings.

Given a field `K` with a subring `R`, in this file we construct a map from polynomials in `K[X]`
with coefficients in `R` to `R[X]`. We provide several lemmas to deal with
coefficients, degree, and evaluation of `intPolynomial`.
This is useful when dealing with integral elements in an extension of fields.

# Main Definitions
* `Polynomial.int` : given a polynomial `P`. in `K[X]` with coefficients in a field `K` with a
  subring `R` such that all coefficients belong to `R`, `P.int R` is the corresponding polynomial
  in `R[X]`.
