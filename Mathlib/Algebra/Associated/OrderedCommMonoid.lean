# Associated, prime, and irreducible elements.

In this file we define the predicate `Prime p`
saying that an element of a commutative monoid with zero is prime.
Namely, `Prime p` means that `p` isn't zero, it isn't a unit,
and `p ∣ a * b → p ∣ a ∨ p ∣ b` for all `a`, `b`;

In decomposition monoids (e.g., `ℕ`, `ℤ`), this predicate is equivalent to `Irreducible`,
however this is not true in general.

We also define an equivalence relation `Associated`
saying that two elements of a monoid differ by a multiplication by a unit.
Then we show that the quotient type `Associates` is a monoid
and prove basic properties of this quotient.
