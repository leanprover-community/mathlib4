# `IsField` predicate

Predicate on a (semi)ring that it is a (semi)field, i.e. that the multiplication is
commutative, that it has more than one element and that all non-zero elements have a
multiplicative inverse. In contrast to `Field`, which contains the data of a function associating
to an element of the field its multiplicative inverse, this predicate only assumes the existence
and can therefore more easily be used to e.g. transfer along ring isomorphisms.

/-- A predicate to express that a (semi)ring is a (semi)field.

This is mainly useful because such a predicate does not contain data,
and can therefore be easily transported along ring isomorphisms.
Additionally, this is useful when trying to prove that
a particular ring structure extends to a (semi)field. -/

/-- For each field, and for each nonzero element of said field, there is a unique inverse.
Since `IsField` doesn't remember the data of an `inv` function and as such,
a lemma that there is a unique inverse could be useful.
