# Division (semi)rings and (semi)fields

This file introduces fields and division rings (also known as skewfields) and proves some basic
statements about them. For a more extensive theory of fields, see the `FieldTheory` folder.

## Main definitions

* `DivisionSemiring`: Nontrivial semiring with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
* `DivisionRing`: : Nontrivial ring with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
* `Semifield`: Commutative division semiring.
* `Field`: Commutative division ring.
* `IsField`: Predicate on a (semi)ring that it is a (semi)field, i.e. that the multiplication is
  commutative, that it has more than one element and that all non-zero elements have a
  multiplicative inverse. In contrast to `Field`, which contains the data of a function associating
  to an element of the field its multiplicative inverse, this predicate only assumes the existence
  and can therefore more easily be used to e.g. transfer along ring isomorphisms.

## Implementation details

By convention `0⁻¹ = 0` in a field or division ring. This is due to the fact that working with total
functions has the advantage of not constantly having to check that `x ≠ 0` when writing `x⁻¹`. With
this convention in place, some statements like `(a + b) * c⁻¹ = a * c⁻¹ + b * c⁻¹` still remain
true, while others like the defining property `a * a⁻¹ = 1` need the assumption `a ≠ 0`. If you are
a beginner in using Lean and are confused by that, you can read more about why this convention is
taken in Kevin Buzzard's
[blogpost](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/division-by-zero-in-type-theory-a-faq/)

A division ring or field is an example of a `GroupWithZero`. If you cannot find
a division ring / field lemma that does not involve `+`, you can try looking for
a `GroupWithZero` lemma instead.

/-- A `DivisionRing` is a `Ring` with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

An instance of `DivisionRing K` includes maps `ratCast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
If the division ring has positive characteristic p, we define `ratCast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`
for consistency with our division by zero convention.
The fields `ratCast` and `qsmul` are needed to implement the
`algebraRat [DivisionRing K] : Algebra ℚ K` instance, since we need to control the specific
definitions for some special cases of `K` (in particular `K = ℚ` itself).
