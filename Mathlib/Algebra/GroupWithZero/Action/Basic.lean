# Definitions of group actions

This file defines a hierarchy of group action type-classes on top of the previously defined
notation classes `SMul` and its additive version `VAdd`:

* `MulAction M α` and its additive version `AddAction G P` are typeclasses used for
  actions of multiplicative and additive monoids and groups; they extend notation classes
  `SMul` and `VAdd` that are defined in `Algebra.Group.Defs`;
* `DistribMulAction M A` is a typeclass for an action of a multiplicative monoid on
  an additive monoid such that `a • (b + c) = a • b + a • c` and `a • 0 = 0`.

The hierarchy is extended further by `Module`, defined elsewhere.

Also provided are typeclasses for faithful and transitive actions, and typeclasses regarding the
interaction of different group actions,

* `SMulCommClass M N α` and its additive version `VAddCommClass M N α`;
* `IsScalarTower M N α` and its additive version `VAddAssocClass M N α`;
* `IsCentralScalar M α` and its additive version `IsCentralVAdd M N α`.

## Notation

- `a • b` is used as notation for `SMul.smul a b`.
- `a +ᵥ b` is used as notation for `VAdd.vadd a b`.

## Implementation details

This file should avoid depending on other parts of `GroupTheory`, to avoid import cycles.
More sophisticated lemmas belong in `GroupTheory.GroupAction`.
