# Descartes' Rule of Signs

We define the "sign changes" in the coefficients of a polynomial, and prove Descartes'
Rule of Signs: a real polynomial has at most as many positive roots as there are sign
changes. A sign change is when there is a positive coefficient followed by a negative
coefficient, or vice versa, with any number of zero coefficients in between.

## Main Definitions

- `Polynomial.signVariations`: The number of sign changes in a polynomial's coefficients,
  where `0` coefficients are ignored.

## Main theorem

- `Polynomial.roots_countP_pos_le_signVariations`. States that
  `P.roots.countP (0 < ·) ≤ P.signVariations`, so that positive roots are counted with multiplicity.
  It's currently proved for any `CommRing` with `IsStrictOrderedRing`. There is likely some correct
  statement in terms of a (noncommutative) `Ring`, but `Polynomial.roots` is only defined for
  commutative rings.
