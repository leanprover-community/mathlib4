# Trailing degree of univariate polynomials

## Main definitions

* `trailingDegree p`: the multiplicity of `X` in the polynomial `p`
* `natTrailingDegree`: a variant of `trailingDegree` that takes values in the natural numbers
* `trailingCoeff`: the coefficient at index `natTrailingDegree p`

Converts most results about `degree`, `natDegree` and `leadingCoeff` to results about the bottom
end of a polynomial
