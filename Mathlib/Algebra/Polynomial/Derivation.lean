# Derivations of univariate polynomials

In this file we prove that an `R`-derivation of `Polynomial R` is determined by its value on `X`.
We also provide a constructor `Polynomial.mkDerivation` that
builds a derivation from its value on `X`, and a linear equivalence
`Polynomial.mkDerivationEquiv` between `A` and `Derivation (Polynomial R) A`.

/--
For a derivation `d : A → M` and an element `a : A`, `d.compAEval a` is the
derivation of `R[X]` which takes a polynomial `f` to `d(aeval a f)`.

This derivation takes values in `Module.AEval R M a`, which is `M`, regarded as an
`R[X]`-module, with the action of a polynomial `f` defined by `f • m = (aeval a f) • m`.
-/
/-
Note: `compAEval` is not defined using `Derivation.compAlgebraMap`.
This because `A` is not an `R[X]` algebra and it would be messy to create an algebra instance
within the definition.

A form of the chain rule: if `f` is a polynomial over `R`
and `d : A → M` is an `R`-derivation then for all `a : A` we have
$$ d(f(a)) = f' (a) d a. $$
The equation is in the `R[X]`-module `Module.AEval R M a`.
For the same equation in `M`, see `Derivation.compAEval_eq`.
