# Polynomial sequences

We define polynomial sequences – sequences of polynomials `a₀, a₁, ...` such that the polynomial
`aᵢ` has degree `i`.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.Sequence R`: the type of polynomial sequences with coefficients in `R`

## Main statements

* `Polynomial.Sequence.basis`: a sequence is a basis for `R[X]`

## TODO

Generalize linear independence to:
  * `IsCancelAdd` semirings
  * just require coefficients are regular
  * arbitrary sets of polynomials which are pairwise different degree.
