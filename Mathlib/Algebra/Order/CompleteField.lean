# Conditionally complete linear ordered fields

This file shows that the reals are unique, or, more formally, given a type satisfying the common
axioms of the reals (field, conditionally complete, linearly ordered) that there is an isomorphism
preserving these properties to the reals. This is `LinearOrderedField.inducedOrderRingIso` for `ℚ`.
Moreover this isomorphism is unique.

We introduce definitions of conditionally complete linear ordered fields, and show all such are
archimedean. We also construct the natural map from a `LinearOrderedField` to such a field.

## Main definitions

* `ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrderedField`: A field satisfying the standard axiomatization of
  the real numbers, being a Dedekind complete and linear ordered field.
* `LinearOrderedField.inducedMap`: A (unique) map from any archimedean linear ordered field to a
  conditionally complete linear ordered field. Various bundlings are available.

## Main results

* `LinearOrderedField.uniqueOrderRingHom` : Uniqueness of `OrderRingHom`s from an archimedean
  linear ordered field to a conditionally complete linear ordered field.
* `LinearOrderedField.uniqueOrderRingIso` : Uniqueness of `OrderRingIso`s between two
  conditionally complete linearly ordered fields.

### Rational cut map

The idea is that a conditionally complete linear ordered field is fully characterized by its copy of
the rationals. Hence we define `LinearOrderedField.cutMap β : α → Set β` which sends `a : α` to the
"rationals in `β`" that are less than `a`.

### Induced map

`LinearOrderedField.cutMap` spits out a `Set β`. To get something in `β`, we now take the supremum.
