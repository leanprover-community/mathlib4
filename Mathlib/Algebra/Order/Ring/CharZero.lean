# Strict ordered semiring have characteristic zero

variable {α : Type*}

/-- The type class assumptions here are the minimal ones required to ensure `CharZero R`. While
all of these are implied by `[StrictOrderedSemiring R]`, this generalization isn't superfluous;
these conditions are also satisfied by the conjunction of `[NonUnitalRing R]`, `[PartialOrder R]`,
`[StarOrderedRing R]`, `[Nontrivial R]` (and these do not imply `StrictOrderedSemiring R`). This
instance gives us access to several lemmas involving `Nat.cast`, such as `Nat.strictMono_cast` for
each of `R`, `selfAdjoint R` and `StarOrderedRing.positive R`.

Note, we assign the priority on this instance lower than `StrictOrderedSemiring.to_CharZero` so
that Lean finds that instance first for the most common use case. This doesn't lead to expensive
`isDefEq` checks because `CharZero α : Prop`. -/
