# Commutative star-ordered rings are ordered rings

A noncommutative star-ordered ring is generally not an ordered ring. Indeed, in a star-ordered
ring, nonnegative elements are self-adjoint, but the product of self-adjoint elements is
self-adjoint if and only if they commute. Therefore, a necessary condition for a star-ordered ring
to be an ordered ring is that all nonnegative elements commute.  Consequently, if a star-ordered
ring is spanned by it nonnegative elements (as is the case for C⋆-algebras) and it is also an
ordered ring, then it is commutative.

In this file we prove the converse: a *commutative* star-ordered ring is an ordered ring.

/- This example shows that nonnegative elements in a ordered semiring which is also star-ordered
must commute. We provide this only as an example as opposed to a lemma because we never expect the
type class assumptions to be satisfied without a `CommSemiring` intance already in scope; not that
it is impossible, only that it shouldn't occur in practice. -/
