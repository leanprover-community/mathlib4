# The rational numbers form a linear ordered field

This file constructs the order on `ℚ` and proves that `ℚ` is a discrete, linearly ordered
commutative ring.

`ℚ` is in fact a linearly ordered field, but this fact is located in `Data.Rat.Field` instead of
here because we need the order on `ℚ` to define `ℚ≥0`, which we itself need to define `Field`.
