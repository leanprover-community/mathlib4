# Linear ordered (semi)fields

A linear ordered (semi)field is a (semi)field equipped with a linear order such that
* addition respects the order: `a ≤ b → c + a ≤ c + b`;
* multiplication of positives is positive: `0 < a → 0 < b → 0 < a * b`;
* `0 < 1`.

## Main Definitions

* `LinearOrderedSemifield`: Typeclass for linear order semifields.
* `LinearOrderedField`: Typeclass for linear ordered fields.
