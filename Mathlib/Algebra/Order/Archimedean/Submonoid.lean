# Submonoids of archimedean monoids

This file defines the instances that show that the (mul)archimedean property is retained in a
submonoid of the ambient group.

## Main statements

* `SubmonoidClass.instMulArchimedean`: the submonoid (and similar subobjects) of a mul-archimedean
  group retains the mul-archimedean property when restricted to the submonoid.
* `AddSubmonoidClass.instArchimedean`: the additive submonoid (and similar subobjects) of an
  archimedean additive group retains the archimedean property when restricted to the additive
  submonoid.
