# Definitions of Archimedean monoids

This file defines the archimedean property for ordered groups.

## Main definitions

* `Archimedean` is a typeclass for an ordered additive commutative monoid to have the archimedean
  property.
* `MulArchimedean` is a typeclass for an ordered commutative monoid to have the "mul-archimedean
  property" where for `x` and `y > 1`, there exists a natural number `n` such that `x ≤ y ^ n`.

/-- An ordered additive commutative monoid is called `Archimedean` if for any two elements `x`, `y`
such that `0 < y`, there exists a natural number `n` such that `x ≤ n • y`. -/
class Archimedean (M) [AddCommMonoid M] [PartialOrder M] : Prop where
  /-- For any two elements `x`, `y` such that `0 < y`, there exists a natural number `n`
  such that `x ≤ n • y`. -/
  arch : ∀ (x : M) {y : M}, 0 < y → ∃ n : ℕ, x ≤ n • y

/-- An ordered commutative monoid is called `MulArchimedean` if for any two elements `x`, `y`
such that `1 < y`, there exists a natural number `n` such that `x ≤ y ^ n`. -/
