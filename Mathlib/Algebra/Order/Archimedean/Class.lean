# Archimedean classes of a linearly ordered group

This file defines archimedean classes of a given linearly ordered group. Archimedean classes
measure to what extent the group fails to be Archimedean. For additive group, elements `a` and `b`
in the same class are "equivalent" in the sense that there exist two natural numbers
`m` and `n` such that `|a| ≤ m • |b|` and `|b| ≤ n • |a|`. An element `a` in a higher class than `b`
is "infinitesimal" to `b` in the sense that `n • |a| < |b|` for all natural number `n`.

## Main definitions

* `ArchimedeanClass` is the archimedean class for additive linearly ordered group.
* `MulArchimedeanClass` is the archimedean class for multiplicative linearly ordered group.
* `ArchimedeanClass.orderHom` and `MulArchimedeanClass.orderHom` are `OrderHom` over
  archimedean classes lifted from ordered group homomorphisms.
* `ArchimedeanClass.ballAddSubgroup` and `MulArchimedeanClass.ballSubgroup` are subgroups
  formed by an open interval of archimedean classes
* `ArchimedeanClass.closedBallAddSubgroup` and `MulArchimedeanClass.closedBallSubgroup` are
  subgroups formed by a closed interval of archimedean classes.

## Main statements

The following theorems state that an ordered commutative group is (mul-)archimedean if and only if
all non-identity elements belong to the same (`Mul`-)`ArchimedeanClass`:
* `ArchimedeanClass.archimedean_of_mk_eq_mk` / `MulArchimedeanClass.mulArchimedean_of_mk_eq_mk`
* `ArchimedeanClass.mk_eq_mk_of_archimedean` / `MulArchimedeanClass.mk_eq_mk_of_mulArchimedean`

## Implementation notes

Archimedean classes are equipped with a linear order, where elements with smaller absolute value
are placed in a *higher* classes by convention. Ordering backwards this way simplifies
formalization of theorems such as the Hahn embedding theorem.

To naturally derive this order, we first define it on the underlying group via the type
synonym (`Mul`-)`ArchimedeanOrder`, and define (`Mul`-)`ArchimedeanClass` as `Antisymmetrization` of
the order.
