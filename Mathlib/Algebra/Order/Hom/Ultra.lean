# Constructing nonarchimedean (ultrametric) normed groups from nonarchimedean normed homs

This file defines constructions that upgrade `Add(Comm)Group` to `(Semi)NormedAdd(Comm)Group`
using an `AddGroup(Semi)normClass` when the codomain is the reals and the hom is nonarchimedean.

## Implementation details

The lemmas need to assume `[Dist α]` to be able to be stated, so they take an extra argument
that shows that this distance instance is propositionally equal to the one that comes from the
hom-based `AddGroupSeminormClass.toSeminormedAddGroup f` construction. To help at use site,
the argument is an autoparam that resolves by definitional equality when using these constructions.

`AddGroupSeminormClass` that satifies `IsNonarchimedean`, the group has an `IsUltrametricDist`. -/
