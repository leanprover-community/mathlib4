# Ordered groups

This file defines bundled ordered groups and develops a few basic results.

## Implementation details

Unfortunately, the number of `'` appended to lemmas in this file
may differ between the multiplicative and the additive version of a lemma.
The reason is that we did not want to change existing names in the library.

`NeZero` theory should not be needed at this point in the ordered algebraic hierarchy.
