# Linearly ordered commutative additive groups and monoids with a top element adjoined

This file sets up a special class of linearly ordered commutative additive monoids
that show up as the target of so-called “valuations” in algebraic number theory.

Usually, in the informal literature, these objects are constructed
by taking a linearly ordered commutative additive group Γ and formally adjoining a
top element: Γ ∪ {⊤}.

The disadvantage is that a type such as `ENNReal` is not of that form,
whereas it is a very common target for valuations.
The solutions is to use a typeclass, and that is exactly what we do in this file.

types with a bottom element. -/
