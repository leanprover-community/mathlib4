# Ordered monoids

This file develops the basics of ordered monoids.

## Implementation details

Unfortunately, the number of `'` appended to lemmas in this file
may differ between the multiplicative and the additive version of a lemma.
The reason is that we did not want to change existing names in the library.

/-- An ordered cancellative additive commutative monoid
is an additive commutative monoid with a partial order,
in which addition is cancellative and monotone. -/
class OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid (α : Type u) extends AddCommMonoid α, PartialOrder α where
  add_le_add_left : ∀ a b : α, a ≤ b → ∀ c : α, c + a ≤ c + b
  le_of_add_le_add_left : ∀ a b c : α, a + b ≤ a + c → b ≤ c
