# Ordered rings and semirings

This file develops the basics of ordered (semi)rings.

Each typeclass here comprises
* an algebraic class (`semiring`, `comm_semiring`, `ring`, `comm_ring`)
* an order class (`partial_order`, `linear_order`)
* assumptions on how both interact ((strict) monotonicity, canonicity)

For short,
* "`+` respects `≤`" means "monotonicity of addition"
* "`+` respects `<`" means "strict monotonicity of addition"
* "`*` respects `≤`" means "monotonicity of multiplication by a nonnegative number".
* "`*` respects `<`" means "strict monotonicity of multiplication by a positive number".

## Typeclasses

* `ordered_semiring`: Semiring with a partial order such that `+` and `*` respect `≤`.
* `strict_ordered_semiring`: Semiring with a partial order such that `+` and `*` respects `<`.
* `ordered_comm_semiring`: Commutative semiring with a partial order such that `+` and `*` respect
  `≤`.
* `strict_ordered_comm_semiring`: Commutative semiring with a partial order such that `+` and `*`
  respect `<`.
* `ordered_ring`: Ring with a partial order such that `+` respects `≤` and `*` respects `<`.
* `ordered_comm_ring`: Commutative ring with a partial order such that `+` respects `≤` and
  `*` respects `<`.
* `linear_ordered_semiring`: Semiring with a linear order such that `+` respects `≤` and
  `*` respects `<`.
* `linear_ordered_comm_semiring`: Commutative semiring with a linear order such that `+` respects
  `≤` and `*` respects `<`.
* `linear_ordered_ring`: Ring with a linear order such that `+` respects `≤` and `*` respects `<`.
* `linear_ordered_comm_ring`: Commutative ring with a linear order such that `+` respects `≤` and
  `*` respects `<`.
* `canonically_ordered_comm_semiring`: Commutative semiring with a partial order such that `+`
  respects `≤`, `*` respects `<`, and `a ≤ b ↔ ∃ c, b = a + c`.

and some typeclasses to define ordered rings by specifying their nonnegative elements:
* `nonneg_ring`: To define `ordered_ring`s.
* `linear_nonneg_ring`: To define `linear_ordered_ring`s.

## Hierarchy

The hardest part of proving order lemmas might be to figure out the correct generality and its
corresponding typeclass. Here's an attempt at demystifying it. For each typeclass, we list its
immediate predecessors and what conditions are added to each of them.

* `ordered_semiring`
  - `ordered_add_comm_monoid` & multiplication & `*` respects `≤`
  - `semiring` & partial order structure & `+` respects `≤` & `*` respects `≤`
* `strict_ordered_semiring`
  - `ordered_cancel_add_comm_monoid` & multiplication & `*` respects `<`
  - `ordered_semiring` & `+` respects `<` & `*` respects `<`
* `ordered_comm_semiring`
  - `ordered_semiring` & commutativity of multiplication
  - `comm_semiring` & partial order structure & `+` respects `≤` & `*` respects `<`
* `strict_ordered_comm_semiring`
  - `strict_ordered_semiring` & commutativity of multiplication
  - `ordered_comm_semiring` & `+` respects `<` & `*` respects `<`
* `ordered_ring`
  - `strict_ordered_semiring` & additive inverses
  - `ordered_add_comm_group` & multiplication & `*` respects `<`
  - `ring` & partial order structure & `+` respects `≤` & `*` respects `<`
* `ordered_comm_ring`
  - `ordered_ring` & commutativity of multiplication
  - `ordered_comm_semiring` & additive inverses
  - `comm_ring` & partial order structure & `+` respects `≤` & `*` respects `<`
* `linear_ordered_semiring`
  - `strict_ordered_semiring` & totality of the order & nontriviality
  - `linear_ordered_add_comm_monoid` & multiplication & nontriviality & `*` respects `<`
* `linear_ordered_comm_semiring`
  - `strict_ordered_comm_semiring` & totality of the order & nontriviality
  - `linear_ordered_semiring` & commutativity of multiplication
* `linear_ordered_ring`
  - `ordered_ring` & totality of the order & nontriviality
  - `linear_ordered_semiring` & additive inverses
  - `linear_ordered_add_comm_group` & multiplication & `*` respects `<`
  - `domain` & linear order structure
* `linear_ordered_comm_ring`
  - `ordered_comm_ring` & totality of the order & nontriviality
  - `linear_ordered_ring` & commutativity of multiplication
  - `linear_ordered_comm_semiring` & additive inverses
  - `is_domain` & linear order structure
* `canonically_ordered_comm_semiring`
  - `canonically_ordered_add_monoid` & multiplication & `*` respects `≤` & no zero divisors
  - `comm_semiring` & `a ≤ b ↔ ∃ c, b = a + c` & no zero divisors

## TODO

We're still missing some typeclasses, like
* `canonically_ordered_semiring`
They have yet to come up in practice.
