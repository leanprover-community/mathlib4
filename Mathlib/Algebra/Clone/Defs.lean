/-! This file defines the notation typeclasse `Superposable` used for working with `Clone`.
  There is a version with bare types `{n m : ℕ} : A n → (T n → A m) → A m`, and a version
  for Sigma types `(x : Sigma A) (y : T x.fst → A m) : Sigma A`. In both of these,
  `A : ι → Type*` is the carrier. A prototypical could have `ι := ℕ`, `T := Fin`, and `A i`
  as some `i`-arity functions.

  This also defines the `OneGradedOne` type class, which gives a graded `One (A 1)`.

  Classes:
  - `Superposable`: A `superpose` operation `A n → (T n → A m) → A m`. This is the type of
    operation used in Clones.
  - `OneGradedOne`: There is a distinguished `1` element at grade 1, a notion of identity.

  Definitions:.
  - `superpose` bundles the action of `Superposable.superpose` into `Sigma A`.

  Notations:
  - `x ∘⚟ y` for `Superposable.superpose x y`. The typography is meant to suggest
    "many arguments into one".
  - `x ∘∈ y` for `superpose x y`, the variant for Sigma types.

/-- A Superposable is a structure that allows "superposition": given an n-arity object
 and n many m-arity objects, they can all enter and share arguments to make a new m-arity
object. `Clone` is the canonical example. -/
