# Covariants and contravariants

This file contains general lemmas and instances to work with the interactions between a relation and
an action on a Type.

The intended application is the splitting of the ordering from the algebraic assumptions on the
operations in the `ordered_[...]` hierarchy.

The strategy is to introduce two more flexible typeclasses, `covariant_class` and
`contravariant_class`:

* `covariant_class` models the implication `a ≤ b → c * a ≤ c * b` (multiplication is monotone),
* `contravariant_class` models the implication `a * b < a * c → b < c`.

Since `co(ntra)variant_class` takes as input the operation (typically `(+)` or `(*)`) and the order
relation (typically `(≤)` or `(<)`), these are the only two typeclasses that I have used.

The general approach is to formulate the lemma that you are interested in and prove it, with the
`ordered_[...]` typeclass of your liking.  After that, you convert the single typeclass,
say `[ordered_cancel_monoid M]`, into three typeclasses, e.g.
`[left_cancel_semigroup M] [partial_order M] [covariant_class M M (function.swap (*)) (≤)]`
and have a go at seeing if the proof still works!

Note that it is possible to combine several co(ntra)variant_class assumptions together.
Indeed, the usual ordered typeclasses arise from assuming the pair
`[covariant_class M M (*) (≤)] [contravariant_class M M (*) (<)]`
on top of order/algebraic assumptions.

A formal remark is that normally `covariant_class` uses the `(≤)`-relation, while
`contravariant_class` uses the `(<)`-relation. This need not be the case in general, but seems to be
the most common usage. In the opposite direction, the implication
```lean
[semigroup α] [partial_order α] [contravariant_class α α (*) (≤)] => left_cancel_semigroup α
```
holds -- note the `co*ntra*` assumption on the `(≤)`-relation.

# Formalization notes

We stick to the convention of using `function.swap (*)` (or `function.swap (+)`), for the
typeclass assumptions, since `function.swap` is slightly better behaved than `flip`.
However, sometimes as a **non-typeclass** assumption, we prefer `flip (*)` (or `flip (+)`),
as it is easier to use. -/

-- TODO: relationship with `con/add_con`
-- TODO: include equivalence of `left_cancel_semigroup` with

/-- Given an action `μ` of a Type `M` on a Type `N` and a relation `r` on `N`, informally, the
`covariant_class` says that "the action `μ` preserves the relation `r`."

More precisely, the `covariant_class` is a class taking two Types `M N`, together with an "action"
`μ : M → N → N` and a relation `r : N → N → Prop`.  Its unique field `elim` is the assertion that
for all `m ∈ M` and all elements `n₁, n₂ ∈ N`, if the relation `r` holds for the pair
`(n₁, n₂)`, then, the relation `r` also holds for the pair `(μ m n₁, μ m n₂)`,
obtained from `(n₁, n₂)` by acting upon it by `m`.

If `m : M` and `h : r n₁ n₂`, then `covariant_class.elim m h : r (μ m n₁) (μ m n₂)`.

More precisely, the `contravariant_class` is a class taking two Types `M N`, together with an
