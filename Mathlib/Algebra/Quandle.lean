# Racks and Quandles

This file defines racks and quandles, algebraic structures for sets
that bijectively act on themselves with a self-distributivity
property.  If `R` is a rack and `act : R → (R ≃ R)` is the self-action,
then the self-distributivity is, equivalently, that
```
act (act x y) = act x * act y * (act x)⁻¹
```
where multiplication is composition in `R ≃ R` as a group.
Quandles are racks such that `act x x = x` for all `x`.

One example of a quandle (not yet in mathlib) is the action of a Lie
algebra on itself, defined by `act x y = Ad (exp x) y`.

Quandles and racks were independently developed by multiple
mathematicians.  David Joyce introduced quandles in his thesis
[Joyce1982] to define an algebraic invariant of knot and link
complements that is analogous to the fundamental group of the
exterior, and he showed that the quandle associated to an oriented
knot is invariant up to orientation-reversed mirror image.  Racks were
used by Fenn and Rourke for framed codimension-2 knots and
links in [FennRourke1992]. Unital shelves are discussed in [crans2017].

The name "rack" came from wordplay by Conway and Wraith for the "wrack
and ruin" of forgetting everything but the conjugation operation for a
group.

## Main definitions

* `Shelf` is a type with a self-distributive action
* `UnitalShelf` is a shelf with a left and right unit
* `Rack` is a shelf whose action for each element is invertible
* `Quandle` is a rack whose action for an element fixes that element
* `Quandle.conj` defines a quandle of a group acting on itself by conjugation.
* `ShelfHom` is homomorphisms of shelves, racks, and quandles.
* `Rack.EnvelGroup` gives the universal group the rack maps to as a conjugation quandle.
* `Rack.oppositeRack` gives the rack with the action replaced by its inverse.

## Main statements
* `Rack.EnvelGroup` is left adjoint to `Quandle.Conj` (`toEnvelGroup.map`).
  The universality statements are `toEnvelGroup.univ` and `toEnvelGroup.univ_uniq`.

## Implementation notes
"Unital racks" are uninteresting (see `Rack.assoc_iff_id`, `UnitalShelf.assoc`), so we do not
define them.

## Notation

The following notation is localized in `quandles`:

* `x ◃ y` is `Shelf.act x y`
* `x ◃⁻¹ y` is `Rack.inv_act x y`
* `S →◃ S'` is `ShelfHom S S'`

Use `open quandles` to use these.

## TODO

* If `g` is the Lie algebra of a Lie group `G`, then `(x ◃ y) = Ad (exp x) x` forms a quandle.
* If `X` is a symmetric space, then each point has a corresponding involution that acts on `X`,
  forming a quandle.
* Alexander quandle with `a ◃ b = t * b + (1 - t) * b`, with `a` and `b` elements
  of a module over `Z[t,t⁻¹]`.
* If `G` is a group, `H` a subgroup, and `z` in `H`, then there is a quandle `(G/H;z)` defined by
  `yH ◃ xH = yzy⁻¹xH`.  Every homogeneous quandle (i.e., a quandle `Q` whose automorphism group acts
  transitively on `Q` as a set) is isomorphic to such a quandle.
  There is a generalization to this arbitrary quandles in [Joyce's paper (Theorem 7.2)][Joyce1982].

### Universal enveloping group of a rack

The universal enveloping group `EnvelGroup R` of a rack `R` is the
universal group such that every rack homomorphism `R →◃ conj G` is
induced by a unique group homomorphism `EnvelGroup R →* G`.
For quandles, Joyce called this group `AdConj R`.

The `EnvelGroup` functor is left adjoint to the `Conj` forgetful
functor, and the way we construct the enveloping group is via a
technique that should work for left adjoints of forgetful functors in
general.  It involves thinking a little about 2-categories, but the
payoff is that the map `EnvelGroup R →* G` has a nice description.

Let's think of a group as being a one-object category.  The first step
is to define `PreEnvelGroup`, which gives formal expressions for all
the 1-morphisms and includes the unit element, elements of `R`,
multiplication, and inverses.  To introduce relations, the second step
is to define `PreEnvelGroupRel'`, which gives formal expressions
for all 2-morphisms between the 1-morphisms.  The 2-morphisms include
associativity, multiplication by the unit, multiplication by inverses,
compatibility with multiplication and inverses (`congr_mul` and
`congr_inv`), the axioms for an equivalence relation, and,
importantly, the relationship between conjugation and the rack action
(see `Rack.ad_conj`).

None of this forms a 2-category yet, for example due to lack of
associativity of `trans`.  The `PreEnvelGroupRel` relation is a
`Prop`-valued version of `PreEnvelGroupRel'`, and making it
`Prop`-valued essentially introduces enough 3-isomorphisms so that
every pair of compatible 2-morphisms is isomorphic.  Now, while
composition in `PreEnvelGroup` does not strictly satisfy the category
axioms, `PreEnvelGroup` and `PreEnvelGroupRel'` do form a weak
2-category.

Since we just want a 1-category, the last step is to quotient
`PreEnvelGroup` by `PreEnvelGroupRel'`, and the result is the
group `EnvelGroup`.

For a homomorphism `f : R →◃ Conj G`, how does
`EnvelGroup.map f : EnvelGroup R →* G` work?  Let's think of `G` as
being a 2-category with one object, a 1-morphism per element of `G`,
and a single 2-morphism called `Eq.refl` for each 1-morphism.  We
define the map using a "higher `Quotient.lift`" -- not only do we
evaluate elements of `PreEnvelGroup` as expressions in `G` (this is
`toEnvelGroup.mapAux`), but we evaluate elements of
`PreEnvelGroup'` as expressions of 2-morphisms of `G` (this is
`toEnvelGroup.mapAux.well_def`).  That is to say,
`toEnvelGroup.mapAux.well_def` recursively evaluates formal
expressions of 2-morphisms as equality proofs in `G`.  Now that all
morphisms are accounted for, the map descends to a homomorphism
`EnvelGroup R →* G`.

Note: `Type`-valued relations are not common.  The fact it is
`Type`-valued is what makes `toEnvelGroup.mapAux.well_def` have
well-founded recursion.
