# Green's Relations Definitions

This file contains the fundamental definitions of Green's relations (L, R, H, D, and J)
on a general semigroup.

## Main definitions

* `IsGreenLeftDvd`: Left divisibility in a semigroup.
* `IsGreenRightDvd`: Right divisibility in a semigroup.
* `IsGreenJRel`: The basic step of being a two-sided multiple.
* `IsGreenL`: Green's L relation (generating the same left ideal).
* `IsGreenR`: Green's R relation (generating the same right ideal).
* `IsGreenH`: Green's H relation (the intersection of L and R).
* `IsGreenD`: Green's D relation (the composition of L and R).
* `IsGreenJ`: Green's J relation (generating the same two-sided ideal).

/-- `IsGreenLeftDvd a b` means that `a` is a left multiple of `b`,
  i.e., `a = b` or `a = z * b`. -/
abbrev IsGreenLeftDvd (a b : S) : Prop := a = b ∨ RightDvd b a

/-- `IsGreenRightDvd a b` means that `a` is a right multiple of `b`,
  i.e., `a = b` or `a = b * z`. -/
abbrev IsGreenRightDvd (a b : S) : Prop := a = b ∨ b ∣ a

/-- `IsGreenJRel a b` represents the basic step of being a two-sided multiple.
  `a` is related to `b` if `a = b`, `a = u * b`, `a = b * v`, or `a = u * b * v`. -/

Here defined explicitly as the existence of an intermediate element `z`. -/
