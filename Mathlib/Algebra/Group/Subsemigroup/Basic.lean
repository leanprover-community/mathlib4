# Subsemigroups: `CompleteLattice` structure

This file defines a `CompleteLattice` structure on `Subsemigroup`s,
and define the closure of a set as the minimal subsemigroup that includes this set.

## Main definitions

For each of the following definitions in the `Subsemigroup` namespace, there is a corresponding
definition in the `AddSubsemigroup` namespace.

* `Subsemigroup.copy` : copy of a subsemigroup with `carrier` replaced by a set that is equal but
  possibly not definitionally equal to the carrier of the original `Subsemigroup`.
* `Subsemigroup.closure` :  semigroup closure of a set, i.e.,
  the least subsemigroup that includes the set.
* `Subsemigroup.gi` : `closure : Set M → Subsemigroup M` and coercion `coe : Subsemigroup M → Set M`
  form a `GaloisInsertion`;

## Implementation notes

Subsemigroup inclusion is denoted `≤` rather than `⊆`, although `∈` is defined as
membership of a subsemigroup's underlying set.

Note that `Subsemigroup M` does not actually require `Semigroup M`,
instead requiring only the weaker `Mul M`.

This file is designed to have very few dependencies. In particular, it should not use natural
numbers.
