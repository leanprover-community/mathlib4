# Subsemigroups: `CompleteLattice` structure

This file defines a `CompleteLattice` structure on `Subsemigroup`s and closure induction principles
for `Subsemigroup`s.

## Implementation notes

Subsemigroup inclusion is denoted `≤` rather than `⊆`, although `∈` is defined as
membership of a subsemigroup's underlying set.

Note that `Subsemigroup M` does not actually require `Semigroup M`,
instead requiring only the weaker `Mul M`.

This file is designed to have very few dependencies. In particular, it should not use natural
numbers.

/- The argument `s : Set M` is explicit in `Subsemigroup.dense_induction` because the type of the
induction variable, namely `x : M`, does not reference `x`. Making `s` explicit allows the user
to apply the induction principle while deferring the proof of `closure s = ⊤` without creating
metavariables, as in the following example. -/
