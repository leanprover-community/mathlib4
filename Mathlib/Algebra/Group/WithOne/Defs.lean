# Adjoining a zero/one to semigroups and related algebraic structures

This file contains different results about adjoining an element to an algebraic structure which then
behaves like a zero or a one. An example is adjoining a one to a semigroup to obtain a monoid. That
this provides an example of an adjunction is proved in
`Mathlib.Algebra.Category.MonCat.Adjunctions`.

Another result says that adjoining to a group an element `zero` gives a `GroupWithZero`. For more
information about these structures (which are not that standard in informal mathematics, see
`Mathlib.Algebra.GroupWithZero.Basic`)

## TODO

`WithOne.coe_mul` and `WithZero.coe_mul` have inconsistent use of implicit parameters
