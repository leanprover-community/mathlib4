# Adjoining a zero/one to semigroups and related algebraic structures

This file contains different results about adjoining an element to an algebraic structure which then
behaves like a zero or a one. An example is adjoining a one to a semigroup to obtain a monoid. That
this provides an example of an adjunction is proved in `Algebra.Category.MonCat.Adjunctions`.

Another result says that adjoining to a group an element `zero` gives a `GroupWithZero`. For more
information about these structures (which are not that standard in informal mathematics, see
`Algebra.GroupWithZero.Basic`)

## Porting notes

In Lean 3, we use `id` here and there to get correct types of proofs. This is required because
`WithOne` and `WithZero` are marked as `irreducible` at the end of
`Mathlib.Algebra.Group.WithOne.Defs`, so proofs that use `Option α` instead of `WithOne α` no
longer typecheck. In Lean 4, both types are plain `def`s, so we don't need these `id`s.

## TODO

`WithOne.coe_mul` and `WithZero.coe_mul` have inconsistent use of implicit parameters
