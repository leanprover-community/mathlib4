# Vertical line test for group homs

This file proves the vertical line test for monoid homomorphisms/isomorphisms.

Let `f : G → H × I` be a homomorphism to a product of monoids. Assume that `f` is surjective on the
first factor and that the image of `f` intersects every "vertical line" `{(h, i) | i : I}` at most
once. Then the image of `f` is the graph of some monoid homomorphism `f' : H → I`.

Furthermore, if `f` is also surjective on the second factor and its image intersects every
"horizontal line" `{(h, i) | h : H}` at most once, then `f'` is actually an isomorphism
`f' : H ≃ I`.

We also prove specialised versions when `f` is the inclusion of a subgroup of the direct product.
(The version for general homomorphisms can easily be reduced to this special case, but the
homomorphism version is more flexible in applications.)
