# Lifting algebraic data classes along injective/surjective maps

This file provides definitions that are meant to deal with
situations such as the following:

Suppose that `G` is a group, and `H` is a type endowed with
`One H`, `Mul H`, and `Inv H`.
Suppose furthermore, that `f : G → H` is a surjective map
that respects the multiplication, and the unit elements.
Then `H` satisfies the group axioms.

The relevant definition in this case is `Function.Surjective.group`.
Dually, there is also `Function.Injective.group`.
And there are versions for (additive) (commutative) semigroups/monoids.
