# Irreducible elements in a monoid

This file defines irreducible elements of a monoid (`Irreducible`), as non-units that can't be
written as the product of two non-units. This generalises irreducible elements of a ring.
We also define the additive variant (`AddIrreducible`).

In decomposition monoids (e.g., `ℕ`, `ℤ`), this predicate is equivalent to `Prime`
(see `irreducible_iff_prime`), however this is not true in general.

/-- `Irreducible p` states that `p` is non-unit and only factors into units.

We explicitly avoid stating that `p` is non-zero, this would require a semiring. Assuming only a
monoid allows us to reuse irreducible for associated elements. -/
