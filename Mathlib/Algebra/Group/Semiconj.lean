# Semiconjugate elements of a semigroup

## Main definitions

We say that `x` is semiconjugate to `y` by `a` (`semiconj_by a x y`), if `a * x = y * a`.
In this file we  provide operations on `semiconj_by _ _ _`.

In the names of these operations, we treat `a` as the “left” argument, and both `x` and `y` as
“right” arguments. This way most names in this file agree with the names of the corresponding lemmas
for `commute a b = semiconj_by a b b`. As a side effect, some lemmas have only `_right` version.

Lean does not immediately recognise these terms as equations, so for rewriting we need syntax like
`rw [(h.pow_right 5).eq]` rather than just `rw [h.pow_right 5]`.

This file provides only basic operations (`mul_left`, `mul_right`, `inv_right` etc). Other
operations (`pow_right`, field inverse etc) are in the files that define corresponding notions.
