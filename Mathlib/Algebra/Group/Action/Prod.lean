# Prod instances for additive and multiplicative actions

This file defines instances for binary product of additive and multiplicative actions and provides
scalar multiplication as a homomorphism from `α × β` to `β`.

## Main declarations

* `smulMulHom`/`smulMonoidHom`: Scalar multiplication bundled as a multiplicative/monoid
  homomorphism.

## See also

* `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Option.lean`
* `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Pi.lean`
* `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Sigma.lean`
* `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Action/Sum.lean`

# Porting notes

The `to_additive` attribute can be used to generate both the `smul` and `vadd` lemmas
from the corresponding `pow` lemmas, as explained on zulip here:
https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/near/316087838

This was not done as part of the port in order to stay as close as possible to the mathlib3 code.
