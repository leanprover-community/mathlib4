# Endomorphisms, homomorphisms and group actions

This file defines `Function.End` as the monoid of endomorphisms on a type,
and provides results relating group actions with these endomorphisms.

## Notation

- `a • b` is used as notation for `SMul.smul a b`.
- `a +ᵥ b` is used as notation for `VAdd.vadd a b`.

## Implementation details

This file should avoid depending on other parts of `GroupTheory`, to avoid import cycles.
More sophisticated lemmas belong in `GroupTheory.GroupAction`.

## Tags
