# Defining a monoid given by generators and relations

Given relations `rels` on the free monoid on a type `α`, this file constructs the monoid
given by generators `x : α` and relations `rels`.

## Main definitions

* `PresentedMonoid rels`: the quotient of the free monoid on a type `α` by the closure of one-step
  reductions (arising from a binary relation on free monoid elements `rels`).
* `PresentedMonoid.of`: The canonical map from `α` to a presented monoid with generators `α`.
* `PresentedMonoid.lift f`: the canonical monoid homomorphism `PresentedMonoid rels → M`, given
  a function `f : α → G` from a type `α` to a monoid `M` which satisfies the relations `rels`.
