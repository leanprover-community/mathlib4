# The distinguished triangle of a short exact sequence in an abelian category

Given a short exact short complex `S` in an abelian category, we construct
the associated distinguished triangle in the derived category:
`(singleFunctor C 0).obj S.X₁ ⟶ (singleFunctor C 0).obj S.X₂ ⟶ (singleFunctor C 0).obj S.X₃ ⟶ ...`

## TODO
* when the canonical t-structure on the derived category is formalized, refactor
this definition to make it a particular case of the triangle induced by a short
exact sequence in the heart of a t-structure
