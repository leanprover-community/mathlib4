# Shapes of homological complexes

We define a structure `ComplexShape ι` for describing the shapes of homological complexes
indexed by a type `ι`.
This is intended to capture chain complexes and cochain complexes, indexed by either `ℕ` or `ℤ`,
as well as more exotic examples.

Rather than insisting that the indexing type has a `succ` function
specifying where differentials should go,
inside `c : ComplexShape` we have `c.Rel : ι → ι → Prop`,
and when we define `HomologicalComplex`
we only allow nonzero differentials `d i j` from `i` to `j` if `c.Rel i j`.
Further, we require that `{ j // c.Rel i j }` and `{ i // c.Rel i j }` are subsingletons.
This means that the shape consists of some union of lines, rays, intervals, and circles.

Convenience functions `c.next` and `c.prev` provide these related elements
when they exist, and return their input otherwise.

This design aims to avoid certain problems arising from dependent type theory.
In particular we never have to ensure morphisms `d i : X i ⟶ X (succ i)` compose as
expected (which would often require rewriting by equations in the indexing type).
Instead such identities become separate proof obligations when verifying that a
complex we've constructed is of the desired shape.

If `α` is an `AddRightCancelSemigroup`, then we define `up α : ComplexShape α`,
the shape appropriate for cohomology, so `d : X i ⟶ X j` is nonzero only when `j = i + 1`,
as well as `down α : ComplexShape α`, appropriate for homology,
so `d : X i ⟶ X j` is nonzero only when `i = j + 1`.
(Later we'll introduce `CochainComplex` and `ChainComplex` as abbreviations for
`HomologicalComplex` with one of these shapes baked in.)

/-- A `c : ComplexShape ι` describes the shape of a chain complex,
with chain groups indexed by `ι`.
Typically `ι` will be `ℕ`, `ℤ`, or `Fin n`.

There is a relation `Rel : ι → ι → Prop`,
and we will only allow a non-zero differential from `i` to `j` when `Rel i j`.

There are axioms which imply `{ j // c.Rel i j }` and `{ i // c.Rel i j }` are subsingletons.
This means that the shape consists of some union of lines, rays, intervals, and circles.

Below we define `c.next` and `c.prev` which provide these related elements.
