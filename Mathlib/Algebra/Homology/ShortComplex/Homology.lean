/-! Homology of short complexes

In this file, we shall define the homology of short complexes `S`, i.e. diagrams
`f : X₁ ⟶ X₂` and `g : X₂ ⟶ X₃` such that `f ≫ g = 0`. We shall say that
`[S.HasHomology]` when there exists `h : S.HomologyData` (TODO). A homology data
for `S` consists of compatible left/right homology data `left` and `right`. The
left homology data `left` involves an object `left.H` that is a cokernel of the canonical
map `S.X₁ ⟶ K` where `K` is a kernel of `g`. On the other hand, the dual notion `right.H`
is a kernel of the canonical morphism `Q ⟶ S.X₃` when `Q` is a cokernel of `f`.
The compatibility that is required involves an isomorphism `left.H ≅ right.H` which
makes a certain pentagon commute.

This definition requires very little assumption on the category (only the existence
of zero morphisms). We shall prove that in abelian categories, all short complexes
have homology data.

Note: This definition arose by the end of the Liquid Tensor Experiment which
contained a structure `has_homology` which is quite similar to `S.HomologyData`.
After the category `ShortComplex C` was introduced by J. Riou, A. Topaz suggested
such a structure could be used as a basis for the *definition* of homology.
