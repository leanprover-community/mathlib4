# `List.count` as a bundled homomorphism

In this file we define `FreeMonoid.countP`, `FreeMonoid.count`, `FreeAddMonoid.countP`, and
`FreeAddMonoid.count`. These are `List.countP` and `List.count` bundled as multiplicative and
additive homomorphisms from `FreeMonoid` and `FreeAddMonoid`.

We do not use `to_additive` too much because it can't map `Multiplicative ℕ` to `ℕ`.
