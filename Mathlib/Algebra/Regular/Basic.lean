# Regular elements

We introduce left-regular, right-regular and regular elements, along with their `to_additive`
analogues add-left-regular, add-right-regular and add-regular elements.

By definition, a regular element in a commutative ring is a non-zero divisor.
Lemma `isRegular_of_ne_zero` implies that every non-zero element of an integral domain is regular.
Since it assumes that the ring is a `CancelMonoidWithZero` it applies also, for instance, to `ℕ`.

The lemmas in Section `MulZeroClass` show that the `0` element is (left/right-)regular if and
only if the `MulZeroClass` is trivial.  This is useful when figuring out stopping conditions for
regular sequences: if `0` is ever an element of a regular sequence, then we can extend the sequence
by adding one further `0`.

The final goal is to develop part of the API to prove, eventually, results about non-zero-divisors.
