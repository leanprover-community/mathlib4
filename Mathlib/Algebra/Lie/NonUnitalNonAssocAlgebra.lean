# Lie algebras as non-unital, non-associative algebras

The definition of Lie algebras uses the `Bracket` typeclass for multiplication whereas we have a
separate `Mul` typeclass used for general algebras.

It is useful to have a special typeclass for Lie algebras because:
 * it enables us to use the traditional notation `⁅x, y⁆` for the Lie multiplication,
 * associative algebras carry a natural Lie algebra structure via the ring commutator and so we
   need them to carry both `Mul` and `Bracket` simultaneously,
 * more generally, Poisson algebras (not yet defined) need both typeclasses.

However there are times when it is convenient to be able to regard a Lie algebra as a general
algebra and we provide some basic definitions for doing so here.

## Main definitions

  * `CommutatorRing` turns a Lie ring into a `NonUnitalNonAssocRing` by turning its
    `Bracket` (denoted `⁅ , ⁆`) into a `Mul` (denoted `*`).
  * `LieHom.toNonUnitalAlgHom`
