# The `RestrictScalars` type alias

See the documentation attached to the `RestrictScalars` definition for advice on how and when to
use this type alias. As described there, it is often a better choice to use the `IsScalarTower`
typeclass instead.

## Main definitions

* `RestrictScalars R S M`: the `S`-module `M` viewed as an `R` module when `S` is an `R`-algebra.
  Note that by default we do *not* have a `Module S (RestrictScalars R S M)` instance
  for the original action.
  This is available as a def `RestrictScalars.moduleOrig` if really needed.
* `RestrictScalars.addEquiv : RestrictScalars R S M ≃+ M`: the additive equivalence
  between the restricted and original space (in fact, they are definitionally equal,
  but sometimes it is helpful to avoid using this fact, to keep instances from leaking).
* `RestrictScalars.ringEquiv : RestrictScalars R S A ≃+* A`: the ring equivalence
   between the restricted and original space when the module is an algebra.

## See also

There are many similarly-named definitions elsewhere which do not refer to this type alias. These
refer to restricting the scalar type in a bundled type, such as from `A →ₗ[R] B` to `A →ₗ[S] B`:

* `LinearMap.restrictScalars`
* `LinearEquiv.restrictScalars`
* `AlgHom.restrictScalars`
* `AlgEquiv.restrictScalars`
* `Submodule.restrictScalars`
* `Subalgebra.restrictScalars`

variable (R S M A : Type*)

/-- If we put an `R`-algebra structure on a semiring `S`, we get a natural equivalence from the
category of `S`-modules to the category of representations of the algebra `S` (over `R`). The type
synonym `RestrictScalars` is essentially this equivalence.

Warning: use this type synonym judiciously! Consider an example where we want to construct an
`R`-linear map from `M` to `S`, given:
```lean
variable (R S M : Type*)
variable [CommSemiring R] [Semiring S] [Algebra R S] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module S M]
```
With the assumptions above we can't directly state our map as we have no `Module R M` structure, but
`RestrictScalars` permits it to be written as:
```lean
-- an `R`-module structure on `M` is provided by `RestrictScalars` which is compatible
example : RestrictScalars R S M →ₗ[R] S := sorry
```
However, it is usually better just to add this extra structure as an argument:
```lean
-- an `R`-module structure on `M` and proof of its compatibility is provided by the user
example [Module R M] [IsScalarTower R S M] : M →ₗ[R] S := sorry
```
The advantage of the second approach is that it defers the duty of providing the missing typeclasses
`[Module R M] [IsScalarTower R S M]`. If some concrete `M` naturally carries these (as is often
the case) then we have avoided `RestrictScalars` entirely. If not, we can pass
`RestrictScalars R S M` later on instead of `M`.

Note that this means we almost always want to state definitions and lemmas in the language of
`IsScalarTower` rather than `RestrictScalars`.

An example of when one might want to use `RestrictScalars` would be if one has a vector space
over a field of characteristic zero and wishes to make use of the `ℚ`-algebra structure. -/
