# Decompositions of additive monoids, groups, and modules into direct sums

## Main definitions

* `DirectSum.Decomposition ℳ`: A typeclass to provide a constructive decomposition from
  an additive monoid `M` into a family of additive submonoids `ℳ`
* `DirectSum.decompose ℳ`: The canonical equivalence provided by the above typeclass


## Main statements

* `DirectSum.Decomposition.isInternal`: The link to `DirectSum.IsInternal`.

## Implementation details

As we want to talk about different types of decomposition (additive monoids, modules, rings, ...),
we choose to avoid heavily bundling `DirectSum.decompose`, instead making copies for the
`AddEquiv`, `LinearEquiv`, etc. This means we have to repeat statements that follow from these
bundled homs, but means we don't have to repeat statements for different types of decomposition.

/-- A decomposition is an equivalence between an additive monoid `M` and a direct sum of additive
submonoids `ℳ i` of that `M`, such that the "recomposition" is canonical. This definition also
works for additive groups and modules.

This is a version of `DirectSum.IsInternal` which comes with a constructive inverse to the
canonical "recomposition" rather than just a proof that the "recomposition" is bijective.

Often it is easier to construct a term of this type via `Decomposition.ofAddHom` or
`Decomposition.ofLinearMap`. -/

/-- The `-` in the statements below doesn't resolve without this line.

This seems to be a problem of synthesized vs inferred typeclasses disagreeing. If we replace
the statement of `decompose_neg` with `@Eq (⨁ i, ℳ i) (decompose ℳ (-x)) (-decompose ℳ x)`
instead of `decompose ℳ (-x) = -decompose ℳ x`, which forces the typeclasses needed by `⨁ i, ℳ i`
to be found by unification rather than synthesis, then everything works fine without this
instance. -/
