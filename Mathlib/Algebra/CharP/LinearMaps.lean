# Characteristic of the ring of linear Maps

This file contains properties of the characteristic of the ring of linear maps.
The characteristic of the ring of linear maps is determined by its base ring.

## Main Results

- `Module.charP_end` : For a commutative semiring `R` and a `R`-module `M`,
  the characteristic of `R` is equal to the characteristic of the `R`-linear
  endomorphisms of `M` when `M` contains a non-torsion element `x`.

## Notations

- `R` is a commutative semiring
- `M` is a `R`-module

## Implementation Notes

One can also deduce similar result via `charP_of_injective_ringHom` and
  `R → (M →ₗ[R] M) : r ↦ (fun (x : M) ↦ r • x)`. But this will require stronger condition
  compared to `Module.charP_end`.
