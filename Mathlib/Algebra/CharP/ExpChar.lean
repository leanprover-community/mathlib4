# Exponential characteristic

This file defines the exponential characteristic, which is defined to be 1 for a ring with
characteristic 0 and the same as the ordinary characteristic, if the ordinary characteristic is
prime. This concept is useful to simplify some theorem statements.
This file establishes a few basic results relating it to the (ordinary characteristic).
The definition is stated for a semiring, but the actual results are for nontrivial rings
(as far as exponential characteristic one is concerned), respectively a ring without zero-divisors
(for prime characteristic).

## Main results
- `ExpChar`: the definition of exponential characteristic
- `expChar_is_prime_or_one`: the exponential characteristic is a prime or one
- `char_eq_expChar_iff`: the characteristic equals the exponential characteristic iff the
  characteristic is prime
