# Characteristics of algebras

In this file we describe the characteristic of `R`-algebras.

In particular we are interested in the characteristic of free algebras over `R`
and the fraction field `FractionRing R`.


## Main results

- `charP_of_injective_algebraMap` If `R →+* A` is an injective algebra map
  then `A` has the same characteristic as `R`.

Instances constructed from this result:
- Any `FreeAlgebra R X` has the same characteristic as `R`.
- The `FractionRing R` of an integral domain `R` has the same characteristic as `R`.

variable (R : Type*) [Nontrivial R]

/-- A nontrivial `ℚ`-algebra has `CharP` equal to zero.

This cannot be a (local) instance because it would immediately form a loop with the
instance `DivisionRing.toRatAlgebra`. It's probably easier to go the other way: prove `CharZero R`
and automatically receive an `Algebra ℚ R` instance.
