# The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and Tsirelson's inequality.

We establish a version of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality
(which is a generalization of Bell's inequality).
This is a foundational result which implies that
quantum mechanics is not a local hidden variable theory.

As usually stated the CHSH inequality requires substantial language from physics and probability,
but it is possible to give a statement that is purely about ordered `*`-algebras.
We do that here, to avoid as many practical and logical dependencies as possible.
Since the algebra of observables of any quantum system is an ordered `*`-algebra
(in particular a von Neumann algebra) this is a strict generalization of the usual statement.

Let `R` be a `*`-ring.

A CHSH tuple in `R` consists of
* four elements `A₀ A₁ B₀ B₁ : R`, such that
* each `Aᵢ` and `Bⱼ` is a self-adjoint involution, and
* the `Aᵢ` commute with the `Bⱼ`.

The physical interpretation is that the four elements are observables (hence self-adjoint)
that take values ±1 (hence involutions), and that the `Aᵢ` are spacelike separated from the `Bⱼ`
(and hence commute).

The CHSH inequality says that when `R` is an ordered `*`-ring
(that is, a `*`-ring which is ordered, and for every `r : R`, `0 ≤ star r * r`),
which is moreover *commutative*, we have
`A₀ * B₀ + A₀ * B₁ + A₁ * B₀ - A₁ * B₁ ≤ 2`

On the other hand, Tsirelson's inequality says that for any ordered `*`-ring we have
`A₀ * B₀ + A₀ * B₁ + A₁ * B₀ - A₁ * B₁ ≤ 2√2`

(A caveat: in the commutative case we need 2⁻¹ in the ring,
and in the noncommutative case we need √2 and √2⁻¹.
To keep things simple we just assume our rings are ℝ-algebras.)

The proofs I've seen in the literature either
assume a significant framework for quantum mechanics,
or assume the ring is a `C^*`-algebra.
In the `C^*`-algebra case,
the order structure is completely determined by the `*`-algebra structure:
`0 ≤ A` iff there exists some `B` so `A = star B * B`.
There's a nice proof of both bounds in this setting at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound
The proof given here is purely algebraic.

## Future work

One can show that Tsirelson's inequality is tight.
In the `*`-ring of n-by-n complex matrices, if `A ≤ λ I` for some `λ : ℝ`,
then every eigenvalue has absolute value at most `λ`.
There is a CHSH tuple in 4-by-4 matrices such that
`A₀ * B₀ + A₀ * B₁ + A₁ * B₀ - A₁ * B₁` has `2√2` as an eigenvalue.

/-- A CHSH tuple in a *-monoid consists of 4 self-adjoint involutions `A₀ A₁ B₀ B₁` such that
the `Aᵢ` commute with the `Bⱼ`.

The physical interpretation is that `A₀` and `A₁` are a pair of boolean observables which
are spacelike separated from another pair `B₀` and `B₁` of boolean observables.

/-- In a noncommutative ordered `*`-algebra over ℝ,
Tsirelson's bound for a CHSH tuple (A₀, A₁, B₀, B₁) is
`A₀ * B₀ + A₀ * B₁ + A₁ * B₀ - A₁ * B₁ ≤ 2^(3/2) • 1`.

We prove this by providing an explicit sum-of-squares decomposition
of the difference.
