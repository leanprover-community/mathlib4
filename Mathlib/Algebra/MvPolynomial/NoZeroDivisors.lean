# Multivariate polynomials over `NoZeroDivisors`

Many results about polynomials hold when the coefficient ring has no zero divisors.

This file does not define any new operations, but proves some of these stronger results.

## Notation

As in other polynomial files, we typically use the notation:

+ `σ : Type*` (indexing the variables)

+ `R : Type*` `[NoZeroDivisors R]` (the coefficients)

+ `s : σ →₀ ℕ`, a function from `σ` to `ℕ` which is zero away from a finite set.
This will give rise to a monomial in `MvPolynomial σ R` which mathematicians might call `X^s`

+ `a : R`

+ `i : σ`, with corresponding monomial `X i`, often denoted `X_i` by mathematicians

+ `p : MvPolynomial σ R`

## TODOs

This file should be extended to include `=` versions of all the `≤` lemmas about degree-related
definitions.
