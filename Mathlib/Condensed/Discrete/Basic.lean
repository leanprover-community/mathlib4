# Discrete-underlying adjunction

Given a category `C` with sheafification with respect to the coherent topology on compact Hausdorff
spaces, we define a functor `C ⥤ Condensed C` which associates to an object of `C` the
corresponding "discrete" condensed object (see `Condensed.discrete`).

In `Condensed.discreteUnderlyingAdj` we prove that this functor is left adjoint to the forgetful
functor from `Condensed C` to `C`.

We also give the variant `LightCondensed.discreteUnderlyingAdj` for light condensed objects.
