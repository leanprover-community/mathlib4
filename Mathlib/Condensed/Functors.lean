# Functors from categories of topological spaces to condensed sets

This file defines the various functors from catgegories of topological spaces to condensed sets.

## Main definitions

* `compHausToCondensed : CompHaus.{u} ⥤ CondensedSet.{u}` is essentially the yoneda presheaf
  functor. We also define `profiniteToCondensed` and `stoneanToCondensed`.

TODO (Dagur):

* Add the functor `TopCat.{u+1} ⥤ CondensedSet.{u}`. This is done in a draft PR which
  depends on the explicit sheaf condition for condensed sets.

* Define the analogues of `compHausToCondensed` for sheaves on `Profinite` and `Stonean` and provide
  the relevant isomorphisms with `profiniteToCondensed` and `stoneanToCondensed`.

* Define the functor `Type (u+1) ⥤ CondensedSet.{u}` which takes a set `X` to the presheaf given by
  mapping a compact Hausdorff space `S` to `LocallyConstant S X`, along with the isomorphism with
  the functor that goes through `TopCat.{u+1}`.
