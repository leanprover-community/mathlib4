# Condensed Objects

This file defines the category of condensed objects in a category `C`, following the work
of Clausen-Scholze and Barwick-Haine.

## Implementation Details

We use the coherent Grothendieck topology on `CompHaus`, and define condensed objects in `C` to
be `C`-valued sheaves, with respect to this Grothendieck topology.

Note: Our definition more closely resembles "Pyknotic objects" in the sense of Barwick-Haine,
as we do not impose cardinality bounds, and manage universes carefully instead.

`Condensed.{u} C` is the category of condensed objects in a category `C`, which are
defined as sheaves on `CompHaus.{u}` with respect to the coherent Grothendieck topology.
