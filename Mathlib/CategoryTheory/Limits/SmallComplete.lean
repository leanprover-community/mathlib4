# Any small complete category is a preorder

We show that any small category which has all (small) limits is a preorder: In particular, we show
that if a small category `C` in universe `u` has products of size `u`, then for any `X Y : C`
there is at most one morphism `X ⟶ Y`.
Note that in Lean, a preorder category is strictly one where the morphisms are in `Prop`, so
we instead show that the homsets are subsingleton.

/-- A small category with products is a thin category.

in Lean, a preorder category is one where the morphisms are in Prop, which is weaker than the usual
notion of a preorder/thin category which says that each homset is subsingleton; we show the latter
rather than providing a `Preorder C` instance.
