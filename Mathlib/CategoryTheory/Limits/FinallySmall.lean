# Finally small categories

A category given by `(J : Type u) [Category.{v} J]` is `w`-finally small if there exists a
`FinalModel J : Type w` equipped with `[SmallCategory (FinalModel J)]` and a final functor
`FinalModel J ⥤ J`.

This means that if a category `C` has colimits of size `w` and `J` is `w`-finally small, then
`C` has limits of shape `J`.
