# Induced categories and full subcategories

Given a category `D` and a function `F : C → D `from a type `C` to the
objects of `D`, there is an essentially unique way to give `C` a
category structure such that `F` becomes a fully faithful functor,
namely by taking $$ Hom_C(X, Y) = Hom_D(FX, FY) $$. We call this the
category induced from `D` along `F`.

## Implementation notes

It looks odd to make `D` an explicit argument of `InducedCategory`,
when it is determined by the argument `F` anyways. The reason to make `D`
explicit is in order to control its syntactic form, so that instances
like `InducedCategory.has_forget₂` (elsewhere) refer to the correct
form of `D`. This is used to set up several algebraic categories like

  def CommMon : Type (u+1) := InducedCategory Mon (Bundled.map @CommMonoid.toMonoid)
  -- not `InducedCategory (Bundled Monoid) (Bundled.map @CommMonoid.toMonoid)`,
  -- even though `MonCat = Bundled Monoid`!

/-- `InducedCategory D F`, where `F : C → D`, is a typeclass synonym for `C`,
which provides a category structure so that the morphisms `X ⟶ Y` are the morphisms
in `D` from `F X` to `F Y`.
