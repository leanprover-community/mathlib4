# The category of small categories has all small colimits.

In this file, the existence of colimits in `Cat` is deduced from the existence of colimits in the
category of simplicial sets. Indeed, `Cat` identifies to a reflective subcategory of the category
of simplicial sets (see `AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialSet.NerveAdjunction`), so that colimits in
`Cat` can be computed by passing to nerves, taking the colimit in `SSet` and finally applying the
homotopy category functor `SSet тед Cat`.
