# Use the `elementwise` attribute to create applied versions of lemmas.

Usually we would use `@[elementwise]` at the point of definition,
however some early parts of the category theory library are imported by `Tactic.Elementwise`,
so we need to add the attribute after the fact.

/-! We now add some `elementwise` attributes to lemmas that were proved earlier. -/

-- Porting note: Iso.hom_inv_id and Iso.inv_hom_id produce trivial elementwise lemmas now.

-- This list is incomplete, and it would probably be useful to add more.
