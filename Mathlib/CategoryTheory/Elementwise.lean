# Use the `elementwise` attribute to create applied versions of lemmas.

Usually we would use `@[elementwise]` at the point of definition,
however some early parts of the category theory library are imported by `Tactic.Elementwise`,
so we need to add the attribute after the fact.

/-! We now add some `elementwise` attributes to lemmas that were proved earlier. -/
