# HasConicalLimits

This file contains different statements about the (non-constructive) existence of conical limits.

The main constructions are the following.

- `HasConicalLimit`: there exists a conical limit for `F : J ⥤ C`.
- `HasConicalLimitsOfShape J`: All functors `F : J ⥤ C` have conical limits.
- `HasConicalLimitsOfSize.{v₁, u₁}`: For all small `J` all functors `F : J ⥤ C` have conical limits.
- `HasConicalLimits `: `C` has all (small) conical limits.
