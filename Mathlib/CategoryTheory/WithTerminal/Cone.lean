# Relations between `Cone`, `WithTerminal` and `Over`

Given categories `C` and `J`, an object `X : C` and a functor `K : J ⥤ Over X`,
it has an obvious lift `liftFromOver K : WithTerminal J ⥤ C`, namely, send the terminal
object to `X`. These two functors have equivalent categories of cones (`coneEquiv`).
As a corollary, the limit of `K` is the limit of `liftFromOver K`, and viceversa.

/-- The category of functors `J ⥤ Over X` can be seen as part of a comma category,
namely the comma category constructed from the identity of the category of functors
`J ⥤ C` and the functor that maps `X : C` to the constant functor `J ⥤ C`.

Given a functor `K : J ⥤ Over X`, it is mapped to a natural transformation from the
obvious functor `J ⥤ C` to the constant functor `X`. -/

A cone of `K` is an object of `Over X`, so it has the form `t ⟶ X`.
Equivalently, a cone of `WithTerminal K` is an object `t : C`,
