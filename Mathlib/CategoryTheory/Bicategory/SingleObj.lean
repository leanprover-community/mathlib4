# Promoting a monoidal category to a single object bicategory.

A monoidal category can be thought of as a bicategory with a single object.

The objects of the monoidal category become the 1-morphisms,
with composition given by tensor product,
and the morphisms of the monoidal category become the 2-morphisms.

We verify that the endomorphisms of that single object recovers the original monoidal category.

One could go much further: the bicategory of monoidal categories
(equipped with monoidal functors and monoidal natural transformations)
is equivalent to the bicategory consisting of
* single object bicategories,
* pseudofunctors, and
* (oplax) natural transformations `η` such that `η.app Unit.unit = 𝟙 _`.
