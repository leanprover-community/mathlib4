# Locally cartesian closed categories

There are several equivalent definitions of locally cartesian closed categories. For instance
the following two definitions are equivalent:

1. A locally cartesian closed category is a category `C` such that for every object `I`
the slice category `Over I` is cartesian closed.

2. Equivalently, a locally cartesian closed category is a category with pullbacks where
all morphisms `f` are exponentiable, that is the base change functor `Over.pullback f`
has a right adjoint for every morphisms `f : I ‚ü∂ J`. This latter condition is equivalent to
exponentiability of `Over.mk f` in `Over J`. The right adjoint of `Over.pullback f`
is called the pushforward functor.

In this file we prove the equivalence of these definitions.

## Implementation notes

The type class `LocallyCartesianClosed` extends `HasPushforwards` with the extra data carrying the
witness of cartesian closedness of the slice categories. `HasPushforwards.cartesianClosedOver` shows
that the cartesian closed structure of the slices follows from existence of pushforwards
along all morphisms. As such when instantiating a `LocallyCartesianClosed` structure,
providing the the cartesian closed structure of the slices is not necessary and it will be filled
in automatically. See `LocallyCartesianClosed.mkOfHasPushforwards` and
`LocallyCartesianClosed.mkOfCartesianClosedOver`.

The advanatge we obtain from this implementation is that when using a
`LocallyCartesianClosed` structure, both the pushforward functor and the cartesian closed structure
of slices are automatically available.

## Main results

- `exponentiableOverMk` shows that the exponentiable structure on a morphism `f` makes
the object `Over.mk f` in the appropriate slice category exponentiable.
- `ofOverExponentiable` shows that an exponentiable object in a slice category gives rise to an
exponentiable morphism.
- `CartesianClosedOver.pushforward` constructs, in a category with cartesian closed slices,
the pushforward functor along a morphism `f : I ‚ü∂ J`.
- `CartesianClosedOver.pushforwardAdj` shows that `pushforward` is right adjoint to the
pullback functor.
- Conversely, `HasPushforwards.cartesianClosedOver` shows that, in a category with pushforwards
along all morphisms, the slice categories are cartesian closed.
- `LocallyCartesianClosed.cartesianClosed` proves that a locally cartesian closed category with a
terminal object is cartesian closed.
- `LocallyCartesianClosed.overLocallyCartesianClosed` shows that the slices of a locally cartesian
closed category are locally cartesian closed.
