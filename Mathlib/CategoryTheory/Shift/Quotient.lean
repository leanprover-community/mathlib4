# The shift on a quotient category

Let `C` be a category equipped a shift by a monoid `A`. If we have a relation
on morphisms `r : HomRel C` that is compatible with the shift (i.e. if two
morphisms `f` and `g` are related, then `f⟦a⟧'` and `g⟦a⟧'` are also related
for all `a : A`), then the quotient category `Quotient r` is equipped with
a shift.

The condition `r.IsCompatibleWithShift A` on the relation `r` is a class so that
the shift can be automatically infered on the quotient category.
