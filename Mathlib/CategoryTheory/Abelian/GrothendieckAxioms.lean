# Grothendieck Axioms

This file defines some of the Grothendieck Axioms for abelian categories, and proves
basic facts about them.

## Definitions

- `AB4` -- an abelian category satisfies `AB4` provided that coproducts are exact.
- `AB5` -- an abelian category satisfies `AB5` provided that filtered colimits are exact.
- The duals of the above definitions, called `AB4Star` and `AB5Star`.

## Theorems

- The implication from `AB5` to `AB4` is established in `AB4.ofAB5`.

## Remarks

For `AB4` and `AB5`, we only require left exactness as right exactness is automatic.
A comparison with Grothendieck's original formulation of the properties can be found in the
comments of the linked Stacks page.
Exactness as the preservation of short exact sequences is introduced in
`CategoryTheory.Abelian.Exact`.

## Projects

- Add additional axioms, especially define Grothendieck categories.
- Prove that `AB5` implies `AB4`.
