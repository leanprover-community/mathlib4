# The abelian image and coimage.

In an abelian category we usually want the image of a morphism `f` to be defined as
`kernel (cokernel.π f)`, and the coimage to be defined as `cokernel (kernel.ι f)`.

We make these definitions here, as `Abelian.image f` and `Abelian.coimage f`
(without assuming the category is actually abelian),
and later relate these to the usual categorical notions when in an abelian category.

There is a canonical morphism `coimageImageComparison : Abelian.coimage f ⟶ Abelian.image f`.
Later we show that this is always an isomorphism in an abelian category,
and conversely a category with (co)kernels and finite products in which this morphism
is always an isomorphism is an abelian category.
