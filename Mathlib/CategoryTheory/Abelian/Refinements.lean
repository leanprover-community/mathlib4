# Refinements

In order to prove injectivity/surjectivity/exactness properties for diagrams
in the category of abelian groups, we often need to do diagram chases.
Some of these can be carried out in more general abelian categories:
for example, a morphism `X ⟶ Y` in an abelian category `C` is a
monomorphism if and only if for all `A : C`, the induced map
`(A ⟶ X) → (A ⟶ Y)` of abelian groups is a monomorphism, i.e. injective.
Alternatively, the Yoneda presheaf functor which sends `X` to the
presheaf of maps `A ⟶ X` for all `A : C` preserves and reflects
monomorphisms.

However, if `p : X ⟶ Y` is an epimorphism in `C` and `A : C`,
`(A ⟶ X) → (A ⟶ Y)` may fail to be surjective (unless `p` is a split
epimorphism).

In this file, the basic result is `epi_iff_surjective_up_to_refinements`
which states that if `f : X ⟶ Y` is a morphism in an abelian category,
then it is an epimorphism if and only if for all `y : A ⟶ Y`,
there exists an epimorphism `π : A' ⟶ A` and `x : A' ⟶ X` such
that `π ≫ y = x ≫ f`. In other words, if we allow a precomposition
with an epimorphism, we may lift a morphism to `Y` to a morphism to `X`.
Following unpublished notes by George Bergman, we shall say that the
precomposition by an epimorphism `π ≫ y` is a refinement of `y`. Then,
we get that an epimorphism is a morphism that is "surjective up to refinements".
(This result is similar to the fact that a morphism of sheaves on
a topological space or a site is epi iff sections can be lifted
locally. Then, arguing "up to refinements" is very similar to
arguing locally for a Grothendieck topology (TODO: indeed,
show that it corresponds to the "refinements" topology on an
abelian category `C` that is defined by saying that
a sieve is covering if it contains an epimorphism)).

Similarly, it is possible to show that a short complex in an abelian
category is exact if and only if it is exact up to refinements
(see `ShortComplex.exact_iff_exact_up_to_refinements`).

As it is outlined in the documentation of the file
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Pseudoelements.lean`, the Freyd-Mitchell
embedding theorem implies the existence of a faithful and exact functor `ι`
from an abelian category `C` to the category of abelian groups. If we
define a pseudo-element of `X : C` to be an element in `ι.obj X`, one
may do diagram chases in any abelian category using these pseudo-elements.
However, using this approach would require proving this embedding theorem!
Currently, mathlib contains a weaker notion of pseudo-elements
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Pseudoelements.lean`. Some theorems can be obtained
using this notion, but there is the issue that for this notion
of pseudo-elements a morphism `X ⟶ Y` in `C` is not determined by
its action on pseudo-elements (see also `Counterexamples/Pseudoelement.lean`).
On the contrary, the approach consisting of working up to refinements
does not require the introduction of other types: we only need to work
with morphisms `A ⟶ X` in `C` which we may consider as being
"sort of elements of `X`". One may carry diagram-chasing by tracking
these morphisms and sometimes introducing an auxiliary epimorphism `A' ⟶ A`.
