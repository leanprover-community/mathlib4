# Guitart exact squares

Given four functors `T`, `L`, `R` and `B`, a 2-square `TwoSquare T L R B` consists of
a natural transformation `w : T ⋙ R ⟶ L ⋙ B`:
```
     T
  C₁ ⥤ C₂
L |     | R
  v     v
  C₃ ⥤ C₄
     B
```

In this file, we define a typeclass `w.GuitartExact` which expresses
that this square is exact in the sense of Guitart. This means that
for any `X₃ : C₃`, the induced functor
`CostructuredArrow L X₃ ⥤ CostructuredArrow R (B.obj X₃)` is final.
It is also equivalent to the fact that for any `X₂ : C₂`, the
induced functor `StructuredArrow X₂ T ⥤ StructuredArrow (R.obj X₂) B`
is initial.

Various categorical notions (fully faithful functors, adjunctions, etc.) can
be characterized in terms of Guitart exact squares. Their particular role
in pointwise Kan extensions shall also be used in the construction of
derived functors.

## TODO

* Define the notion of derivability structure from
[the paper by Kahn and Maltsiniotis][KahnMaltsiniotis2008] using Guitart exact squares
and construct (pointwise) derived functors using this notion
