# Pulling back filteredness along representably flat functors

We show that if `F : C ‚•§ D` is a representably coflat functor between two categories,
filteredness of `D` implies filteredness of `C`. Dually, if `F` is representably flat,
cofilteredness of `D` implies cofilteredness of `C`.

Transferring (co)filteredness *along* representably (co)flat functors is given by
`IsFiltered.of_final` and its dual, since every representably flat functor is final and every
representably coflat functor is initial.
