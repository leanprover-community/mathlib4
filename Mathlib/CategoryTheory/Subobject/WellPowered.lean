# Well-powered categories

A category `(C : Type u) [Category.{v} C]` is `[WellPowered C]` if
for every `X : C`, we have `Small.{v} (Subobject X)`.

(Note that in this situation `Subobject X : Type (max u v)`,
so this is a nontrivial condition for large categories,
but automatic for small categories.)

This is equivalent to the category `MonoOver X` being `EssentiallySmall.{v}` for all `X : C`.

When a category is well-powered, you can obtain nonconstructive witnesses as
`Shrink (Subobject X) : Type v`
and
`equivShrink (Subobject X) : Subobject X ≃ Shrink (subobject X)`.

/--
A category (with morphisms in `Type v`) is well-powered if `Subobject X` is `v`-small for every `X`.

We show in `wellPowered_of_essentiallySmall_monoOver` and `essentiallySmall_monoOver`
that this is the case if and only if `MonoOver X` is `v`-essentially small for every `X`.
