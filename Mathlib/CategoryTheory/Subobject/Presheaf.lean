# Subobjects presheaf

Following Section I.3 of [Sheaves in Geometry and Logic][MM92], we define the subobjects presheaf
`Subobject.presheaf C` mapping any object `X` to its type of subobjects `Subobject X`.

## Main definitions

Let `C` refer to a category with pullbacks.

* `CategoryTheory.Subobject.presheaf C` is the presheaf that sends every object `X : C` to its
  category of subobjects `Subobject X`, and every morphism `f : X ⟶ Y` to the function
  `Subobject Y → Subobject X` that maps every subobject of `Y` to its pullback along `f`.

  theory*][MM92]
