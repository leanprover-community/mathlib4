# Linearly disjoint fields

This file contains basics about the linearly disjoint fields.
We adapt the definitions in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_disjoint>.
See the file `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearDisjoint.lean`
and `Mathlib/RingTheory/LinearDisjoint.lean` for details.

## Main definitions

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint`: an intermediate field `A` of `E / F`
  and an abstract field `L` between `E / F`
  (as a special case, two intermediate fields) are linearly disjoint over `F`,
  if they are linearly disjoint as subalgebras (`Subalgebra.LinearDisjoint`).

## Implementation notes

The `Subalgebra.LinearDisjoint` is stated for two `Subalgebra`s. The original design of
`IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint` is also stated for two `IntermediateField`s
(see `IntermediateField.linearDisjoint_iff'` for the original statement).
But it's probably useful if one of them can be generalized to an abstract field
(see <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9651#discussion_r1464070324>).
This leads to the current design of `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint`
which is for one `IntermediateField` and one abstract field.
It is not generalized to two abstract fields as this will break the dot notation.

## Main results

### Equivalent characterization of linear disjointness

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_left`:
  if `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint, then any `F`-linearly independent family on `A` remains
  linearly independent over `L`.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_basis_left`:
  conversely, if there exists an `F`-basis of `A` which remains linearly independent over `L`, then
  `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_right`:
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_right'`:
  if `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint, then any `F`-linearly independent family on `L` remains
  linearly independent over `A`.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_basis_right`:
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_basis_right'`:
  conversely, if there exists an `F`-basis of `L` which remains linearly independent over `A`, then
  `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_mul`:
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_mul'`:
  if `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint, then for any family of
  `F`-linearly independent elements `{ a_i }` of `A`, and any family of
  `F`-linearly independent elements `{ b_j }` of `L`, the family `{ a_i * b_j }` in `S` is
  also `F`-linearly independent.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_basis_mul`:
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_basis_mul'`:
  conversely, if `{ a_i }` is an `F`-basis of `A`, if `{ b_j }` is an `F`-basis of `L`,
  such that the family `{ a_i * b_j }` in `E` is `F`-linearly independent,
  then `A` and `L` are linearly disjoint.

### Equivalent characterization by `IsDomain` or `IsField` of tensor product

The following results are related to the equivalent characterizations in
<https://mathoverflow.net/questions/8324>.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.isDomain'`,
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.exists_field_of_isDomain`:
  if `A` and `B` are field extensions of `F`, then `A ⊗[F] B`
  is a domain if and only if there exists a field extension of `F` that `A` and `B`
  embed into with linearly disjoint images.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.isField_of_forall`,
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_isField'`:
  if `A` and `B` are field extensions of `F`, then `A ⊗[F] B`
  is a field if and only if for any field extension of `F` that `A` and `B` embed into, their
  images are linearly disjoint.

- `Algebra.TensorProduct.isField_of_isAlgebraic`:
  if `E` and `K` are field extensions of `F`, one of them is algebraic, and
  `E ⊗[F] K` is a domain, then `E ⊗[F] K` is also a field.
  See `Algebra.TensorProduct.isAlgebraic_of_isField` for its converse (in an earlier file).

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.isField_of_isAlgebraic`,
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.isField_of_isAlgebraic'`:
  if `A` and `B` are field extensions of `F`, one of them is algebraic, such that they are linearly
  disjoint (more generally, if there exists a field extension of `F` that they embed into with
  linearly disjoint images), then `A ⊗[F] B` is a field.

### Other main results

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.symm`, `IntermediateField.linearDisjoint_comm`:
  linear disjointness is symmetric.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.map`:
  linear disjointness is preserved by algebra homomorphism.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.rank_sup`,
  `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.finrank_sup`:
  if `A` and `B` are linearly disjoint,
  then the rank of `A ⊔ B` is equal to the product of the rank of `A` and `B`.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_finrank_sup`:
  conversely, if `A` and `B` are finite extensions,
  such that rank of `A ⊔ B` is equal to the product of the rank of `A` and `B`,
  then `A` and `B` are linearly disjoint.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.of_finrank_coprime`:
  if the rank of `A` and `B` are coprime,
  then `A` and `B` are linearly disjoint.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.inf_eq_bot`:
  if `A` and `B` are linearly disjoint, then they are disjoint.

- `IntermediateField.LinearDisjoint.algEquiv_of_isAlgebraic`:
  linear disjointness is preserved by isomorphisms, provided that one of the field is algebraic.
