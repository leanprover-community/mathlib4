# Relative Algebraic Closure

In this file we construct the relative algebraic closure of a field extension.

## Main Definitions

- `algebraicClosure F E` is the relative algebraic closure (i.e. the maximal algebraic subextension)
  of the field extension `E / F`, which is defined to be the integral closure of `F` in `E`.

/--
The *relative algebraic closure* of a field `F` in a field extension `E`,
also called the *maximal algebraic subextension* of `E / F`,
is defined to be the subalgebra `integralClosure F E`
upgraded to an intermediate field (since `F` and `E` are both fields).
This is exactly the intermediate field of `E / F` consisting of all integral/algebraic elements.
