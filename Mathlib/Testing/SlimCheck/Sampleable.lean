# `SampleableExt` Class

This class permits the creation samples of a given type
controlling the size of those values using the `Gen` monad.

# `Shrinkable` Class

This class helps minimize examples by creating smaller versions of
given values.

When testing a proposition like `∀ n : ℕ, prime n → n ≤ 100`,
`SlimCheck` requires that `ℕ` have an instance of `SampleableExt` and for
`prime n` to be decidable.  `SlimCheck` will then use the instance of
`SampleableExt` to generate small examples of ℕ and progressively increase
in size. For each example `n`, `prime n` is tested. If it is false,
the example will be rejected (not a test success nor a failure) and
`SlimCheck` will move on to other examples. If `prime n` is true,
`n ≤ 100` will be tested. If it is false, `n` is a counter-example of
`∀ n : ℕ, prime n → n ≤ 100` and the test fails. If `n ≤ 100` is true,
the test passes and `SlimCheck` moves on to trying more examples.

This is a port of the Haskell QuickCheck library.

## Main definitions

* `SampleableExt` class
* `Shrinkable` class

### `SampleableExt`

`SampleableExt` can be used in two ways. The first (and most common)
is to simply generate values of a type directly using the `Gen` monad,
if this is what you want to do then `SampleableExt.mkSelfContained` is
the way to go.

Furthermore it makes it possible to express generators for types that
do not lend themselves to introspection, such as `ℕ → ℕ`.
If we test a quantification over functions the
counter-examples cannot be shrunken or printed meaningfully.
For that purpose, `SampleableExt` provides a proxy representation
`proxy` that can be printed and shrunken as well
as interpreted (using `interp`) as an object of the right type. If you
are using it in the first way, this proxy type will simply be the type
itself and the `interp` function `id`.

### `Shrinkable`

Given an example `x : α`, `Shrinkable α` gives us a way to shrink it
and suggest simpler examples.

## Shrinking

Shrinking happens when `SlimCheck` find a counter-example to a
property.  It is likely that the example will be more complicated than
necessary so `SlimCheck` proceeds to shrink it as much as
possible. Although equally valid, a smaller counter-example is easier
for a user to understand and use.

The `Shrinkable` class, , has a `shrink` function so that we can use
specialized knowledge while shrinking a value. It is not responsible
for the whole shrinking process however. It only has to take one step
in the shrinking process. `SlimCheck` will repeatedly call `shrink`
until no more steps can be taken. Because `shrink` guarantees that the
size of the candidates it produces is strictly smaller than the
argument, we know that `SlimCheck` is guaranteed to terminate.
