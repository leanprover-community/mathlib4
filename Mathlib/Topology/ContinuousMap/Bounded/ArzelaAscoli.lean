# The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem for bounded continuous functions

Arzelà–Ascoli asserts that, on a compact space, a set of functions sharing a common modulus of
continuity and taking values in a compact set forms a compact subset for the topology of
uniform convergence. This file proves the theorem and several useful variations around it.

  /- We have to find a finite discretization of `u`, i.e., finite information
    that is sufficient to reconstruct `u` up to `ε`. This information will be
    provided by the values of `u` on a sufficiently dense set `tα`,
    slightly translated to fit in a finite `ε₂`-dense set `tβ` in the image. Such
    sets exist by compactness of the source and range. Then, to check that these
    data determine the function up to `ε`, one uses the control on the modulus of
    continuity to extend the closeness on tα to closeness everywhere. -/
