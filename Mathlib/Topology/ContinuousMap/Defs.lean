# Continuous bundled maps

In this file we define the type `ContinuousMap` of continuous bundled maps.

We use the `DFunLike` design, so each type of morphisms has a companion typeclass
which is meant to be satisfied by itself and all stricter types.

/-- The type of continuous maps from `X` to `Y`.

When possible, instead of parametrizing results over `(f : C(X, Y))`,
you should parametrize over `{F : Type*} [ContinuousMapClass F X Y] (f : F)`.

When you extend this structure, make sure to extend `ContinuousMapClass`. -/
