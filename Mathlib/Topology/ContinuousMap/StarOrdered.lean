/-! # Continuous functions as a star-ordered ring

The type class `ContinuousSqrt` gives a sufficient condition on `R` to make `C(α, R)`
and `C(α, R)₀` into a `StarOrderedRing` for any topological space `α`, thereby providing a means
by which we can ensure `C(α, R)` has this property. This condition is satisfied
by `ℝ≥0`, `ℝ`, and `ℂ`, and the instances can be found in the file
`Mathlib/Topology/ContinuousMap/ContinuousSqrt.lean`.

## Implementation notes

Instead of asking for a well-behaved square root on `{x : R | 0 ≤ x}` in the obvious way, we instead
require that, for every `x y  : R` such that `x ≤ y`, there exist some `s` such that `x + s*s = y`.
This is because we need this type class to work for `ℝ≥0` for the
continuous functional calculus. We could instead assume `[OrderedSub R] [ContinuousSub R]`, but that
would lead to a proliferation of type class assumptions in the general case of the continuous
functional calculus, which we want to avoid because there is *already* a proliferation of type
classes there. At the moment, we only expect this class to be used in that context so this is a
reasonable compromise.

The field `ContinuousSqrt.sqrt` is data, which means that, if we implement an instance of the class
for a generic C⋆-algebra, we'll get a non-defeq diamond for the case `R := ℂ`. This shouldn't really
be a problem since the only purpose is to obtain the instance `StarOrderedRing C(α, R)`, which is a
`Prop`, but we note it for future reference.

/-- A type class encoding the property that there is a continuous square root function on
nonnegative elements. This holds for `ℝ≥0`, `ℝ` and `ℂ` (as well as any C⋆-algebra), and this
allows us to derive an instance of `StarOrderedRing C(α, R)` under appropriate hypotheses.
In order for this to work on `ℝ≥0`, we actually must force our square root function to be defined
on and well-behaved for pairs `x : R × R` with `x.1 ≤ x.2`. -/
