# Lawson topology

This file introduces the Lawson topology on a preorder.

## Main definitions

- `Topology.lawson` - the Lawson topology is defined as the meet of the lower topology and the
  Scott topology.
- `Topology.IsLawson.lawsonBasis` - The complements of the upper closures of finite sets
  intersected with Scott open sets.

## Main statements

- `Topology.IsLawson.isTopologicalBasis` - `Topology.IsLawson.lawsonBasis` is a basis for
  `Topology.IsLawson`
- `Topology.lawsonOpen_iff_scottOpen_of_isUpperSet'` - An upper set is Lawson open if and only if it
  is Scott open
- `Topology.lawsonClosed_iff_dirSupClosed_of_isLowerSet` - A lower set is Lawson closed if and only
  if it is closed under sups of directed sets
- `Topology.IsLawson.t0Space` - The Lawson topology is T₀

## Implementation notes

A type synonym `Topology.WithLawson` is introduced and for a preorder `α`, `Topology.WithLawson α`
is made an instance of `TopologicalSpace` by `Topology.lawson`.

We define a mixin class `Topology.IsLawson` for the class of types which are both a preorder and a
topology and where the topology is `Topology.lawson`.
It is shown that `Topology.WithLawson α` is an instance of `Topology.IsLawson`.
