# The reals are equipped with their order topology

This file contains results related to the order topology on (extended) (non-negative) real numbers.
We
- prove that `ℝ` and `ℝ≥0` are equipped with the order topology and bornology,
- endow `EReal` with the order topology (and prove some very basic lemmas),
- define the topology `ℝ≥0∞` (which is the order topology, *not* the `EMetricSpace` topology)

### Topological structure on `EReal`

We endow `EReal` with the order topology.
Most proofs are adapted from the corresponding proofs on `ℝ≥0∞`.

/-- Topology on `ℝ≥0∞`.

Note: this is different from the `EMetricSpace` topology. The `EMetricSpace` topology has
`IsOpen {∞}`, while this topology doesn't have singleton elements. -/
