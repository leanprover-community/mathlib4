# UpperSet and LowerSet topologies

This file introduces the upper set topology on a preorder as the topology where the open sets are
the upper sets and the lower set topology on a preorder as the topology where the open sets are
the lower sets.

In general the upper set topology does not coincide with the upper topology and the lower set
topology does not coincide with the lower topology.

## Main statements

- `UpperSetTopology.IsOpen_sInter` - the intersection of any set of open sets is open
- `UpperSetTopology.IsOpen_iInter` - the intersection of any indexed collection of open sets is open
- `UpperSetTopology.isClosed_iff_isLower` - a set is closed if and only if it is a Lower set
- `UpperSetTopology.closure_eq_lowerClosure` - topological closure coincides with lower closure
- `UpperSetTopology.Monotone_tfae` - the continuous functions are characterised as the monotone
  functions
- `UpperSetTopology.Monotone_to_UpperTopology_Continuous` - a `Monotone` map from a `Preorder`
  with the `UpperSetTopology` to `Preorder` with the `UpperTopology` is `Continuous`

## Implementation notes

A type synonym `WithUpperSetTopology` is introduced and for a preorder `α`, `WithUpperSetTopology α`
is made an instance of `TopologicalSpace` by the topology where the upper sets are the open sets.

We define a mixin class `UpperSetTopology` for the class of types which are both a preorder and a
topology and where the open sets are the upper sets. It is shown that `WithUpperSetTopology α` is an
instance of `UpperSetTopology`.

Similarly for the lower set topology.

## Motivation

An Alexandrov topology is a topology where the intersection of any collection of open sets is open.
The `UpperSetTopology` is an Alexandrov topology, and, given any Alexandrov topology, a `Preorder`
may be defined on the underlying set such that the `UpperSetTopology` of the `Preorder` coincides
with the original topology.

Furthermore, the `UpperSetTopology` is used in the construction of the Scott Topology.
