# Scott Complete Partial Order

Properties of Scott topologies over (Directed) `CompletePartialOrder`, and Algebraic DCPOs.

## Main Definitions
- `Compact`: The element x is compact if for any directed subset A ⊆ D, whenever `x ≤ sSup A`,
  there is some a ∈ A s.t. x ≤ a already.
- `AlgebraicDCPO`: an extension of `CompletePartialOrder` which is additionally "algebraic".
  Algebraicity has a correspondence with the 'inaccessibility of directed joins'
  property of Scott topologies, which can be seen in some of the proofs below.

## Main Statements
- `specialization_iff_ge`: The original order and the specialization order induced by the Scott
  topology, correspond. Prop 3.5.2 in [reneta2024]. Prop 2.3.2(1) in [abramsky_gabbay_maibaum_1994]
- `isTopologicalBasis_of_Ici_compact`: The upward closures of compact elements form a topological
  basis under the Scott Topology. Prop 3.5.2 in [reneta2024]
- `open_eq_of_open_basis'`: Explicit construction an Open set from the basis mentioned above.
  Prop 2.3.6(2) [abramsky_gabbay_maibaum_1994]

## Notation
* `e` `c` : elements in the a set, usually of an open set, often compact.
  referred to as a `point` from here onwards
* `e'` : upwards closures of point.

## Implementation notes
The file is laid out simnilar to ScottTopology.lean

## References
Statements and proofs match the first reference. Exact or equivalent statements in the 2nd reference
are provided
