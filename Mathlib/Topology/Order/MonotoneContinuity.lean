# Continuity of monotone functions

In this file we prove the following fact: if `f` is a monotone function on a neighborhood of `a`
and the image of this neighborhood is a neighborhood of `f a`, then `f` is continuous at `a`, see
`continuousWithinAt_of_monotoneOn_of_image_mem_nhds`, as well as several similar facts.

We also prove that an `OrderIso` is continuous.

continuous at `a` from the right.

The assumption `hfs : ∀ b > f a, ∃ c ∈ s, f c ∈ Ioc (f a) b` is required because otherwise the
function `f : ℝ → ℝ` given by `f x = if x ≤ 0 then x else x + 1` would be a counter-example at

### Continuity of order isomorphisms

In this section we prove that an `OrderIso` is continuous, hence it is a `Homeomorph`. We prove
