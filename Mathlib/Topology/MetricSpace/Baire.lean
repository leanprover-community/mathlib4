# Baire theorem

In a complete metric space, a countable intersection of dense open subsets is dense.

The good concept underlying the theorem is that of a Gδ set, i.e., a countable intersection
of open sets. Then Baire theorem can also be formulated as the fact that a countable
intersection of dense Gδ sets is a dense Gδ set. We prove Baire theorem, giving several different
formulations that can be handy. We also prove the important consequence that, if the space is
covered by a countable union of closed sets, then the union of their interiors is dense.

We also define the filter `residual α` generated by dense `Gδ` sets and prove that this filter
has the countable intersection property.
