# The completion of a metric space

Completion of uniform spaces are already defined in `Topology.UniformSpace.Completion`. We show
here that the uniform space completion of a metric space inherits a metric space structure,
by extending the distance to the completion and checking that it is indeed a distance, and that
it defines the same uniformity as the already defined uniform structure on the completion

        continuous functions). Therefore, the preimage of the ε-neighborhood of the diagonal in ℝ
        is an entourage in `Completion α × Completion α`. Massaging this property, it follows that
        the ε-neighborhood of the diagonal is an entourage in `Completion α`, and therefore this is
        also the case of `s`. -/
