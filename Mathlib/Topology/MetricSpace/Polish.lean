# Polish spaces

A topological space is Polish if its topology is second-countable and there exists a compatible
complete metric. This is the class of spaces that is well-behaved with respect to measure theory.
In this file, we establish the basic properties of Polish spaces.

## Main definitions and results

* `PolishSpace α` is a mixin typeclass on a topological space, requiring that the topology is
  second-countable and compatible with a complete metric. To endow the space with such a metric,
  use in a proof `letI := upgradePolishSpace α`.
  We register an instance from complete second-countable metric spaces to Polish spaces, not the
  other way around.
* We register that countable products and sums of Polish spaces are Polish.
* `IsClosed.polishSpace`: a closed subset of a Polish space is Polish.
* `IsOpen.polishSpace`: an open subset of a Polish space is Polish.
* `exists_nat_nat_continuous_surjective`: any nonempty Polish space is the continuous image
  of the fundamental Polish space `ℕ → ℕ`.

A fundamental property of Polish spaces is that one can put finer topologies, still Polish,
with additional properties:

* `exists_polishSpace_forall_le`: on a topological space, consider countably many topologies
  `t n`, all Polish and finer than the original topology. Then there exists another Polish
  topology which is finer than all the `t n`.
* `IsClopenable s` is a property of a subset `s` of a topological space, requiring that there
  exists a finer topology, which is Polish, for which `s` becomes open and closed. We show that
  this property is satisfied for open sets, closed sets, for complements, and for countable unions.
  Once Borel-measurable sets are defined in later files, it will follow that any Borel-measurable
  set is clopenable. Once the Lusin-Souslin theorem is proved using analytic sets, we will even
  show that a set is clopenable if and only if it is Borel-measurable, see
  `isClopenable_iff_measurableSet`.

/-! ### Basic properties of Polish spaces -/


/-- A Polish space is a topological space with second countable topology, that can be endowed
with a metric for which it is complete.
We register an instance from complete second countable metric space to polish space, and not the
other way around as this is the most common use case.

To endow a Polish space with a complete metric space structure, do `letI := upgradePolishSpace α`.

### An open subset of a Polish space is Polish

To prove this fact, one needs to construct another metric, giving rise to the same topology,
for which the open subset is complete. This is not obvious, as for instance `(0,1) ⊆ ℝ` is not
complete for the usual metric of `ℝ`: one should build a new metric that blows up close to the
boundary.

Porting note: definitions and lemmas in this section now take `(s : Opens α)` instead of
`{s : Set α} (hs : IsOpen s)` so that we can turn various definitions and lemmas into instances.
Also, some lemmas used to assume `Set.Nonempty sᶜ` in Lean 3. In fact, this assumption is not
needed, so it was dropped.
