/-! # Germs of continuous maps

In this file we introduce continuity of germs. For our purposes a germ at `x` is continuous if the
functions representing it are continuous on a neighbourhood of `x`; note that this does not
necessarily mean that it can be represented by a globally continuous function.

We also provide types `ContinuousGerm x Y` and `PointedContinuousGerm x y` of bundled continuous
germs, and show that these can be composed.

## Main results & definitions
* `Germ.ContinuousAt`: a germ `f` at `x` satisfies `f.ContinuousAt` if the functions representing it
  are continuous at `x`.
* `Germ.Continuous`: a germ `f` at `x` is continuous if the functions representing it are continuous
  on some neighbourhood of `x`.
* `ContinuousGerm x Y`: the type of continuous `Y`-valued germs at `x`.
* `ContinuousGerm.comp f g h`: the composition of two continuous germs `f : ContinuousGerm y Z` and
  `g : ContinuousGerm x Y`, provided `h : g.toGerm.value = y`.
* `PointedContinuousGerm x y`: the type of continuous germs at `x` sending `x` to `y`.
* `PointedContinuousGerm.comp f g`: the composition of two continuous germs
  `f : PointedContinuousGerm y z` and `g : PointedContinuousGerm x y`.

## TODOs
* Equip `ContinuousGerm x Y` with the topology coinduced by all restriction maps from
  `ContinuousMap u Y` for neighbourhoods `u` of `x`, and `PointedContinuousGerm x y` with the
  induced topology.
* Prove that `PointedContinuousGerm x x` is a topological monoid under multiplication.
* Equip `ContinuousGerm x Y` with the corresponding pointwise operations when `Y` is a topological
  group / ring / module etc.

/-- A germ `f` at `x` is called continuous at `x` if it is represented by functions that are
continuous at `x`.

Note that this is weaker than being represented by a function that is continuous on an open
neighbourhood around `x`: the functions representing `x` may still have discontinuities arbitrarily
close to `x`. -/
