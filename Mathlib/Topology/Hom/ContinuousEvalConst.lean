# Bundled morphisms with continuous evaluation at a point

In this file we define a typeclass
saying that `F` is a type of bundled morphisms (in the sense of `DFunLike`)
with a topology on `F` such that evaluation at a point is continuous in `f : F`.

## Implementation Notes

For now, we define the typeclass for non-dependent bundled functions only.
Whenever we add a type of bundled dependent functions with a topology having this property,
we may decide to generalize from `FunLike` to `DFunLike`.
