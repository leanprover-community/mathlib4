# Delta-generated topological spaces

This file defines delta-generated spaces, as topological spaces whose topology is coinduced by all
maps from euclidean spaces into them. This is the strongest topological property that holds for
all CW-complexes and is closed under quotients and disjoint unions; every delta-generated space is
locally path-connected, sequential and in particular compactly generated.

## TODO
* All locally path-connected first-countable spaces are delta-generated - in particular, all normed
  spaces and convex subsets thereof, like the standard simplices and the unit interval.
* Delta-generated spaces are equivalently generated by the simplices Δⁿ.
* Delta-generated spaces are equivalently generated by the unit interval I.
