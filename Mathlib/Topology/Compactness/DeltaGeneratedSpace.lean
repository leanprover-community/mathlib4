# Delta-generated topological spaces

This file defines delta-generated spaces, as topological spaces whose topology is coinduced by all
maps from euclidean spaces into them. This is the strongest topological property that is holds for
all CW-complexes and is closed under quotients and disjoit unions; every delta-generated space is
locally path-connected, sequential and in particular compactly generated.

TODO:
* Delta-generated spaces are equivalently generated by the simplices Δⁿ.
* Delta-generated spaces are equivalently generated by the unit interval I.
* Disjoint unions of delta-generated spaces are delta-generated.
* Quotients of delta-generated spaces are delta-generated.
