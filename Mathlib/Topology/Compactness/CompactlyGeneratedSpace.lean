# Compactly generated topological spaces

This file defines compactly generated topological spaces. A compactly generated space is a space `X`
whose topology is coinduced by continuous maps from compact Hausdorff spaces to `X`. In such a
space, a set `s` is closed (resp. open) if and only if for all compact Hausdorff space `K` and
`f : K → X` continuous, `f ⁻¹' s` is closed (resp. open) in `K`.

We provide two definitions. `UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{u} X` corresponds to the type class where the
compact Hausdorff spaces are taken in an arbitrary universe `u`, and should therefore always be used
with an explicit universe parameter. It is intended for categorical purposes.

`CompactlyGeneratedSpace X` corresponds to the case where compact Hausdorff spaces are taken in
the same universe as `X`, and is intended for topological purposes.

We prove basic properties and instances, and prove that a `SequentialSpace` is compactly generated,
as well as a Hausdorff `WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace`.

## Main definitions

* `UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{u} X`: the topology of `X` is coinduced by continuous maps coming from
  compact Hausdorff spaces in universe `u`.
* `CompactlyGeneratedSpace X`: the topology of `X` is coinduced by continuous maps coming from
  compact Hausdorff spaces in the same universe as `X`.

/--
The compactly generated topology on a topological space `X`. This is the finest topology
which makes all maps from compact Hausdorff spaces to `X`, which are continuous for the original
topology, continuous.

Note: this definition should be used with an explicit universe parameter `u` for the size of the
compact Hausdorff spaces mapping to `X`.

A topological space `X` is compactly generated if its topology is finer than (and thus equal to)
the compactly generated topology, i.e. it is coinduced by the continuous maps from compact
Hausdorff spaces to `X`.

This version includes an explicit universe parameter `u` which should always be specified. It is
intended for categorical purposes. See `CompactlyGeneratedSpace` for the version without this
parameter, intended for topological purposes.
