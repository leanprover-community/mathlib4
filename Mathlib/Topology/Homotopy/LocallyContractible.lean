# Strongly locally contractible spaces

This file defines `LocallyContractibleSpace` and `StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace`.

## Main definitions

* `LocallyContractibleSpace X`: classical local contractibility (null-homotopic inclusions).
* `StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace X`: a space where each point has a neighborhood basis
  consisting of contractible sets (not necessarily open).

## Main results

* `StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace.locallyContractible`: SLC implies classical LC
* `instLocPathConnectedSpace`: strongly locally contractible spaces are locally path-connected
* `StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace.of_bases`: a helper to construct strongly locally contractible
  spaces from a neighborhood basis
* `contractible_subset_basis`: basis of contractible neighborhoods contained in an open set
* `IsOpenEmbedding.stronglyLocallyContractibleSpace`: open embeddings preserve strong local
  contractibility
* `IsOpen.stronglyLocallyContractibleSpace`: open subsets of strongly locally contractible spaces
  are strongly locally contractible
* Products of strongly locally contractible spaces are strongly locally contractible

## TODO

* Define contractible components and prove they are open in strongly locally contractible spaces
* Add examples: convex sets, real vector spaces, star-shaped sets

## Notes

**Terminology:** The classical definition of *locally contractible* (LC) requires that for every
point `x` and neighborhood `U ∋ x`, there exists a neighborhood `V ∋ x` with `V ⊆ U` such that the
inclusion `V ↪ U` is null-homotopic. The definition here is **strictly stronger**: we require
contractible neighborhoods to form a neighborhood basis. This is often called **strongly locally
contractible** (SLC).

**Hierarchy of notions:**
* "Basis of open contractible neighborhoods" (strongest)
* "Basis of contractible neighborhoods" (this file, SLC)
* "Null-homotopic inclusions" (classical LC, weakest)

This naming is not used uniformly: according to
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+contractible+space
the second and third notion here could also be called
"locally contractible" and "semilocally contractible" respectively.
We've enquired at
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5109428/terminology-for-local-contractibility-locally-contractible-vs-strongly-local
in the hope of getting definitive naming advice.

The Borsuk-Mazurkiewicz counterexample [borsuk_mazurkiewicz1934] shows that classical LC does not
imply SLC. Moreover, from a contractible neighborhood `S` one generally cannot shrink to an open
`V ⊆ S` that remains contractible, so requiring neighborhoods to be open is potentially strictly
stronger than SLC.

there exists a neighborhood V ⊆ U such that the inclusion V ↪ U is null-homotopic.

section StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace

/-- A topological space is **strongly locally contractible** if, at every point, contractible
neighborhoods form a neighborhood basis. Here "contractible" means contractible as a subspace.

This is strictly stronger than the classical notion of locally contractible, which only requires
null-homotopic inclusions.
This distinction is witnessed by an example from Borsuk-Mazurkiewicz [borsuk_mazurkiewicz1934];
see also [MO88628] for discussion and the Whitehead manifold example. -/
