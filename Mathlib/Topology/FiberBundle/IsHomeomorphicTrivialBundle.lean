# Maps equivariantly-homeomorphic to projection in a product

This file contains the definition `IsHomeomorphicTrivialFiberBundle F p`, a Prop saying that a
map `p : Z → B` between topological spaces is a "trivial fiber bundle" in the sense that there
exists a homeomorphism `h : Z ≃ₜ B × F` such that `proj x = (h x).1`.  This is an abstraction which
is occasionally convenient in showing that a map is open, a quotient map, etc.

This material was formerly linked to the main definition of fiber bundles, but after a series of
refactors, there is no longer a direct connection.
