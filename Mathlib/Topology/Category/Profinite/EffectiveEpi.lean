# Effective epimorphic families in `Profinite`

Let `π a : X a ⟶ B` be a family of morphisms in `Profinite` indexed by a finite type `α`.
In this file, we show that the following are all equivalent:
- The family `π` is effective epimorphic.
- The induced map `∐ X ⟶ B` is epimorphic.
- The family `π` is jointly surjective.

## Main results

- `Profinite.effectiveEpiFamily_tfae`: characterise being an effective epimorphic family.
- `Profinite.instPrecoherent`: `Profinite` is precoherent.

## Implementation notes

The entire section `EffectiveEpiFamily` comprises exclusively a technical construction for
the main proof and does not contain any statements that would be useful in other contexts.

This section contains exclusively technical definitions and results that are used
in the proof of `Profinite.effectiveEpiFamily_of_jointly_surjective`.

The construction of `QB` as a quotient of the maps `X a → B` is analoguous to the
construction in the file `CompHaus.EffectiveEpi`,
but one has to start with an equivalence relation on `Profinite` instead.
