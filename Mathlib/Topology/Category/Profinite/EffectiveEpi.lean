# Effective epimorphisms and finite effective epimorphic families in `Profinite`

This file proves that `Profinite` is `Preregular`. Together with the fact that it is
`FinitaryPreExtensive`, this implies that `Profinite` is `Precoherent`.

To do this, we need to characterise effective epimorphisms in `Profinite`. As a consequence, we also
get a characterisation of finite effective epimorphic families.

## Main results

* `Profinite.effectiveEpi_tfae`: For a morphism in `Profinite`, the conditions surjective,
  epimorphic, and effective epimorphic are all equivalent.

* `Profinite.effectiveEpiFamily_tfae`: For a finite family of morphisms in `Profinite` with fixed
  target in `Profinite`, the conditions jointly surjective, jointly epimorphic and effective
  epimorphic are all equivalent.

As a consequence, we obtain instances that `Profinite` is precoherent and preregular.

- TODO: Write API for reflecting effective epimorphisms and deduce the contents of this file by
  abstract nonsense from the corresponding results for `CompHaus`.

Implementation: If `π` is a surjective morphism in `Profinite`, then it is an effective epi.
The theorem `Profinite.effectiveEpi_tfae` should be used instead.
