# Effective epimorphisms in `CompHaus`

This file proves that `EffectiveEpi`, `Epi` and `Surjective` are all equivalent in `CompHaus`.
As a consequence we deduce from the material in
`Mathlib.Topology.Category.CompHausLike.EffectiveEpi` that `CompHaus` is `Preregular`
and `Precoherent`.

We also prove that for a finite family of morphisms in `CompHaus` with fixed
target, the conditions jointly surjective, jointly epimorphic and effective epimorphic are all
equivalent.

## Projects

- Define regular categories, and show that `CompHaus` is regular.
- Define coherent categories, and show that `CompHaus` is actually coherent.
