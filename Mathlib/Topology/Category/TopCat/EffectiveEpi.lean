# Effective epimorphisms in `TopCat`

This file proves the result `TopCat.effectiveEpi_iff_isQuotientMap`:
The effective epimorphisms in `TopCat` are precisely the quotient maps.

Implementation: If `π` is a morphism in `TopCat` which is a quotient map, then it is an effective
epimorphism. The theorem `TopCat.effectiveEpi_iff_isQuotientMap` should be used instead of
this definition.
