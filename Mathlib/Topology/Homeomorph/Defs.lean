# Homeomorphisms

This file defines homeomorphisms between two topological spaces. They are bijections with both
directions continuous. We denote homeomorphisms with the notation `≃ₜ`.

# Main definitions and results

* `Homeomorph X Y`: The type of homeomorphisms from `X` to `Y`.
  This type can be denoted using the following notation: `X ≃ₜ Y`.
* `HomeomorphClass`: `HomeomorphClass F A B` states that `F` is a type of homeomorphisms.

* `Homeomorph.symm`: the inverse of a homeomorphism
* `Homeomorph.trans`: composing two homeomorphisms
* Homeomorphisms are open and closed embeddings, inducing, quotient maps etc.
* `Homeomorph.homeomorphOfContinuousOpen`: A continuous bijection that is
  an open map is a homeomorphism.
* `Homeomorph.homeomorphOfUnique`: if both `X` and `Y` have a unique element, then `X ≃ₜ Y`.
* `Equiv.toHomeomorph`: an equivalence between topological spaces respecting openness
  is a homeomorphism.

* `IsHomeomorph`: the predicate that a function is a homeomorphism

/-- Predicate saying that `f` is a homeomorphism.

This should be used only when `f` is a concrete function whose continuous inverse is not easy to
write down. Otherwise, `Homeomorph` should be preferred as it bundles the continuous inverse.

Having both `Homeomorph` and `IsHomeomorph` is justified by the fact that so many function
properties are unbundled in the topology part of the library, and by the fact that a homeomorphism
is not merely a continuous bijection, that is `IsHomeomorph f` is not equivalent to
`Continuous f ∧ Bijective f` but to `Continuous f ∧ Bijective f ∧ IsOpenMap f`. -/
