# One-point compactification and projectivization

We construct a set-theoretic equivalence between
`OnePoint K` and the projectivization `ℙ K (Fin 2 → K)` for an arbitrary division ring `K`.

TODO: Add the extension of this equivalence to a homeomorphism in the case `K = ℝ`,
where `OnePoint ℝ` gets the topology of one-point compactification.


## Main definitions

* `divOnePoint`: Division on `K` taking values in `OnePoint K`. Notation: `÷`.
* `divSlope`: Lowering `divOnePoint` to a map `ℙ K (Fin 2 → K) → OnePoint K`.

## Main results

* `divSlope_equiv` proves that `ℙ K (Fin 2 → K) ≃ OnePoint K`.

### Definition and basic properties

We define a division operation `divOnePoint`, with notation `÷`.
It takes inputs from a division ring `K` and outputs a value in `K ∪ {∞}`, i.e.,  `OnePoint K`.
We prove that `÷` preserves projective equivalence: `(c•a)÷(c•b)=a÷b`.
Hence `÷` projects down to a map `divSlope` from `ℙ K (Fin 2 → K)` to `OnePoint K`
that takes a line through the origin and returns its slope. For a vertical line
the slope is `∞`.
