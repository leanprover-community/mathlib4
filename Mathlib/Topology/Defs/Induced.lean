# Induced and coinduced topologies

In this file we define the induced and coinduced topologies,
as well as topology inducing maps, topological embeddings, and quotient maps.

## Main definitions

* `TopologicalSpace.induced`: given `f : X → Y` and a topology on `Y`,
  the induced topology on `X` is the collection of sets
  that are preimages of some open set in `Y`.
  This is the coarsest topology that makes `f` continuous.

* `TopologicalSpace.coinduced`: given `f : X → Y` and a topology on `X`,
  the coinduced topology on `Y` is defined such that
  `s : Set Y` is open if the preimage of `s` is open.
  This is the finest topology that makes `f` continuous.

* `IsInducing`: a map `f : X → Y` is called *inducing*,
  if the topology on the domain is equal to the induced topology.

* `Embedding`: a map `f : X → Y` is an *embedding*,
  if it is a topology inducing map and it is injective.

* `IsOpenEmbedding`: a map `f : X → Y` is an *open embedding*,
  if it is an embedding and its range is open.
  An open embedding is an open map.

* `IsClosedEmbedding`: a map `f : X → Y` is an *open embedding*,
  if it is an embedding and its range is open.
  An open embedding is an open map.

* `IsQuotientMap`: a map `f : X → Y` is a *quotient map*,
  if it is surjective
  and the topology on the codomain is equal to the coinduced topology.

/-- We say that restrictions of the topology on `X` to sets from a family `S`
generates the original topology,
if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:

- a set which is relatively open in each `s ∈ S` is open;
- a set which is relatively closed in each `s ∈ S` is closed;
- for any topological space `Y`, a function `f : X → Y` is continuous
  provided that it is continuous on each `s ∈ S`.
