# Sequences in topological spaces

In this file we define sequential closure, continuity, compactness etc.

## Main definitions

### Set operation
* `seqClosure s`: sequential closure of a set, the set of limits of sequences of points of `s`;

### Predicates

* `IsSeqClosed s`: predicate saying that a set is sequentially closed, i.e., `seqClosure s ‚äÜ s`;
* `SeqContinuous f`: predicate saying that a function is sequentially continuous, i.e.,
  for any sequence `u : ‚Ñï ‚Üí X` that converges to a point `x`, the sequence `f ‚àò u` converges to
  `f x`;
* `IsSeqCompact s`: predicate saying that a set is sequentially compact, i.e., every sequence
  taking values in `s` has a converging subsequence.

### Type classes

* `FrechetUrysohnSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is a *Fr√©chet-Urysohn
  space*, i.e., the sequential closure of any set is equal to its closure.
* `SequentialSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is a *sequential space*, i.e.,
  any sequentially closed set in this space is closed. This condition is weaker than being a
  Fr√©chet-Urysohn space.
* `SeqCompactSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is sequentially compact, i.e.,
  every sequence in `X` has a converging subsequence.
