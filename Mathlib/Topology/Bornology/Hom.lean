# Locally bounded maps

This file defines locally bounded maps between bornologies.

We use the `DFunLike` design, so each type of morphisms has a companion typeclass which is meant to
be satisfied by itself and all stricter types.

## Types of morphisms

* `LocallyBoundedMap`: Locally bounded maps. Maps which preserve boundedness.

## Typeclasses

* `LocallyBoundedMapClass`
