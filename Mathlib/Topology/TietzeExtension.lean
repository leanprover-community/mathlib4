# Tietze extension theorem

In this file we prove a few version of the Tietze extension theorem. The theorem says that a
continuous function `s → ℝ` defined on a closed set in a normal topological space `Y` can be
extended to a continuous function on the whole space. Moreover, if all values of the original
function belong to some (finite or infinite, open or closed) interval, then the extension can be
chosen so that it takes values in the same interval. In particular, if the original function is a
bounded function, then there exists a bounded extension of the same norm.

The proof mostly follows <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Tietze+extension+theorem>. We patch a small
gap in the proof for unbounded functions, see
`exists_extension_forall_exists_le_ge_of_closedEmbedding`.

In addition we provide a class `TietzeExtension` encoding the idea that a topological space
satisfies the Tietze extension theorem. This allows us to get a version of the Tietze extension
theorem that simultaneously applies to `ℝ`, `ℝ × ℝ`, `ℂ`, `ι → ℝ`, `ℝ≥0` et cetera. At some point
in the future, it may be desirable to provide instead a more general approach via
*absolute retracts*, but the current implementation covers the most common use cases easily.

## Implementation notes

We first prove the theorems for a closed embedding `e : X → Y` of a topological space into a normal
topological space, then specialize them to the case `X = s : Set Y`, `e = (↑)`.
