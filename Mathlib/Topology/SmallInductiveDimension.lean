# Small inductive dimension

The small inductive dimension of a space is inductively defined as follows. Empty spaces have
small inductive dimension less than 0, and a topological space has dimension less than `n + 1` if
it has a topological basis whose elements have frontiers of dimension strictly less `n`.

In this file we formalize this notion, and characterize the cases `n = 0` and `n = 1`.

## Main definitions

* `HasSmallInductiveDimensionLT X n` : Provides a class stating that `X` has small inductive
  dimension less than `n`.
* `HasSmallInductiveDimensionLE X n` : Provides an abbrev for
  `HasSmallInductiveDimensionLT X (n + 1)`.
* `smallInductiveDimension X` : The small inductive dimension of `X`, with values in `WithBot ℕ∞`.

/--
For a topological space, the property of having small inductive dimension less than `n : ℕ`  is
inductively defined as follows. Empty spaces have small inductive dimension less than 0, and a
topological space has dimension less than `n + 1` if it has a topological basis whose elements have
frontiers of dimension strictly less `n`.
