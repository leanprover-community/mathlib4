# Partial homeomorphisms and continuity

## Main theorems

* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.map_nhds_eq`: an open partial homeomorphism preserves the neighbourhood
  filter of any point in its source.
* `OpenPartialHomeomorph.continuousAt_iff_continuousAt_comp_left`,
  `OpenPartialHomeomorph.continuousAt_iff_continuousAt_comp_right`: a function is continuous at
  a point iff its pre / post composition with an open partial homeomorphism is so (assuming the
  point is in the source / target).
