# A map is proper iff preimage of compact sets are compact

This file proves that if `Y` is a Hausdorff and compactly generated space, a continuous map
`f : X → Y` is proper if and only if preimage of compact sets are compact.

/-- If `Y` is Hausdorff and compactly generated, then proper maps `X → Y` are exactly
continuous maps such that the preimage of any compact set is compact. This is in particular true
if `Y` is Hausdorff and sequential or locally compact.

There was an older version of this theorem which was changed to this one to make use
of the `CompactlyGeneratedSpace` typeclass. (since 2024-11-10) -/
