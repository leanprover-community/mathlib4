/-- A map `f : X → Y` is proper if and only if it is continuous and **universally closed**, in the
sense that for any topological space `Z`, the map `Prod.map f id : X × Z → Y × Z` is closed. Note
that `Z` lives in the same universe as `X` here, but `IsProperMap.universally_closed` does not
have this restriction.

This is taken as the definition of properness in
[N. Bourbaki, *General Topology*][bourbaki1966]. -/
