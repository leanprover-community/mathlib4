# Open quotient maps

An open quotient map is an open map `f : X → Y` which is both an open map and a quotient map.
Equivalently, it is a surjective continuous open map.
We use the latter characterization as a definition.

Many important quotient maps are open quotient maps, including

- the quotient map from a topological space to its quotient by the action of a group;
- the quotient map from a topological group to its quotient by a normal subgroup;
- the quotient map from a topological spaace to its separation quotient.

Contrary to general quotient maps,
the category of open quotient maps is closed under `Prod.map`.

Given the following diagram with `f` inducing, `p` surjective,
`q` an open quotient map, and `g` injective. Suppose the image of `A` in `B` is stable
under the equivalence mod `q`, then the coinduced topology on `C` (from `A`)
coincides with the induced topology (from `D`).
```
A -f→ B
∣     ∣
p     q
↓     ↓
C -g→ D
```

A typical application is when `K ≤ H` are subgroups of `G`, then the quotient topology on `H/K`
is also the subspace topology from `G/K`.
