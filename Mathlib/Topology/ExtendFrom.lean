# Extending a function from a subset

The main definition of this file is `extendFrom A f` where `f : X → Y`
and `A : Set X`. This defines a new function `g : X → Y` which maps any
`x₀ : X` to the limit of `f` as `x` tends to `x₀`, if such a limit exists.

This is analogous to the way `IsDenseInducing.extend` "extends" a function
`f : X → Z` to a function `g : Y → Z` along a dense inducing `i : X → Y`.

The main theorem we prove about this definition is `continuousOn_extendFrom`
which states that, for `extendFrom A f` to be continuous on a set `B ⊆ closure A`,
it suffices that `f` converges within `A` at any point of `B`, provided that
`f` is a function to a T₃ space.

at any `x₀`, if `f` converges to some `y` as `x` tends to `x₀` within `A`,
