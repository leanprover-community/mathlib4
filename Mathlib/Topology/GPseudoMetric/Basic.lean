# General Pseudo-Metrics

In this file we introduce `GPseudoMetric`.
This differs from `PseudoMetricSpace` by not requiring that the codomain of the metric be `ℝ`,
instead only requiring that it is an (additive) commutative monoid, with a linear ordering that
respects sensible assumptions about interactions between `+` and `≤`.

## Main Definitions

- `GPseudoMetric α β`: A structure containing a distance function on `α` with codomain `β`,
which may be equal to 0 for non-equal elements. the distance function is 0 for equal elements,
is commutative in its arguments, and satisifies the triangle inequality.
- `GPseudoMetricClass α β`: The class of types of generic pseudo metrics on `α` to `β`.

Additional useful definitions:

- `ball gdist x δ`: The set of points with distance to x strictly less than δ
- `closedBall gdist x δ`: The set of points with distance to x less than or equal to δ
- `sphere gdist x δ`: The set of points with distance to x equal to δ

/-- Generic pseudo metrics

A generic pseudo metric is a distance function `gdist : α → α → β`, which is zero for
identical elements, for which the arguments commute, and for which the triangle
inequality holds. As opposed to a classical pseudo metric, the codomain of this distance
function is not necessarily ℝ (or ℝ≥0∞), and as a result does not endow α with a uniform
space.
