# IsOrderedAddCommMonoid mixin

This file defines a mixin class for combining kinds orderings and kinds of AddCommMonoid.
This allows for previously undefined combinations like combining `CompleteLinearOrder` and
`AddCommMonoid`, preventing the need for defining increasingly complex combinations of the two.

## Main Definitions:

- `IsOrderedAddCommMonoid α`: A mixin for `PartialOrder α` and a
`AddCommMonoid α` such that weak inequalities are maintained under adding constants.
- `IsOrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α`: A mixin for `PartialOrder α` and a
`AddCommMonoid α` such that weak inequalities are maintained under both adding and
cancelling out the adding of constants.

Additional useful definitions:

- `instance LinearOrderedAddCommMonoid α`
given `IsOrderedAddCommMonoid α` and `LinearOrder α`
- `instance LinearOrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α`
given `IsOrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α` and `LinearOrder α`
