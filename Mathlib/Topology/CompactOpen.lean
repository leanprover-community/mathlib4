# The compact-open topology

In this file, we define the compact-open topology on the set of continuous maps between two
topological spaces.

## Main definitions

* `CompactOpen` is the compact-open topology on `C(α, β)`. It is declared as an instance.
* `ContinuousMap.coev` is the coevaluation map `β → C(α, β × α)`. It is always continuous.
* `ContinuousMap.curry` is the currying map `C(α × β, γ) → C(α, C(β, γ))`. This map always exists
  and it is continuous as long as `α × β` is locally compact.
* `ContinuousMap.uncurry` is the uncurrying map `C(α, C(β, γ)) → C(α × β, γ)`. For this map to
  exist, we need `β` to be locally compact. If `α` is also locally compact, then this map is
  continuous.
* `Homeomorph.curry` combines the currying and uncurrying operations into a homeomorphism
  `C(α × β, γ) ≃ₜ C(α, C(β, γ))`. This homeomorphism exists if `α` and `β` are locally compact.
