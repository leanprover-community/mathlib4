# Semicontinuous maps

A function `f` from a topological space `α` to an ordered space `β` is *lower semicontinuous* at a
point `x` if, for any `y < f x`, for any `x'` close enough to `x`, one has `f x' > y`. In other
words, `f` can jump up, but it cannot jump down.

*Upper semicontinuous* functions are defined similarly. Upper and lower hemicontinuity (of
functions `f : α → Set β`) are often defined in terms of sequential characterizations, but
here we take an equivalent approach. `f : α → Set β` is *upper hemicontinuous* at `x` if for any
neighborhood of `f x`, `f x'` is included in this neighborhood for all `x'` close enough to `x`.

Of course, one can see a superficial similarity between upper semicontinuity and upper
hemicontinuity. In fact, we can unify all of upper and lower semicontinuity and also upper and
lower hemicontinuity under one umbrella, by considering a general relation `r : α → β → Prop` and
defining semicontinuity of this relation.

This file introduces these notions, and a basic API around them mimicking the API for continuous
functions.

## Main definitions and results

We introduce 4 generic definitions related to semicontinuity:
* `SemicontinuousWithinAt r s x`
* `SemicontinuousAt r x`
* `SemicontinuousOn r s`
* `Semicontinuous r`

We build a basic API using dot notation around these notions, and we prove that
* constant functions are semicontinuous;
* right composition with continuous functions preserves semicontinuity;

We also define lower and upper semicontinuity as abbreviations of these generic definitions
and transfer the generic results to these notions.
