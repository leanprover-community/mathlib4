# Lower and Upper Semicontinuity

This file develops key properties of upper and lower semicontinuous functions.

## Main definitions and results

We have some equivalent definitions of lower- and upper-semicontinuity (under certain
restrictions on the order on the codomain):
* `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isOpen_preimage` in a linear order;
* `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_preimage` in a linear order;
* `lowerSemicontinuousAt_iff_le_liminf` in a complete linear order;
* `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_epigraph` in a linear order with the order
  topology.

We also prove:

* `indicator s (fun _ ↦ y)` is lower semicontinuous when `s` is open and `0 ≤ y`,
  or when `s` is closed and `y ≤ 0`;
* continuous functions are lower semicontinuous;
* left composition with a continuous monotone functions maps lower semicontinuous functions to lower
  semicontinuous functions. If the function is anti-monotone, it instead maps lower semicontinuous
  functions to upper semicontinuous functions;
* a sum of two (or finitely many) lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous;
* a supremum of a family of lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous;
* An infinite sum of `ℝ≥0∞`-valued lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous.

Similar results are stated and proved for upper semicontinuity.

We also prove that a function is continuous if and only if it is both lower and upper
semicontinuous.

## Implementation details

All the nontrivial results for upper semicontinuous functions are deduced from the corresponding
ones for lower semicontinuous functions using `OrderDual`.

  and `r := (fun x s ↦ s ∈ 𝓝ˢ (f x))`, respectively.
