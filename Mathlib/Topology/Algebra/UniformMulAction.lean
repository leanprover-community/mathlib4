# Multiplicative action on the completion of a uniform space

In this file we define typeclasses `UniformContinuousConstVAdd` and
`UniformContinuousConstSMul` and prove that a multiplicative action on `X` with uniformly
continuous `(•) c` can be extended to a multiplicative action on `UniformSpace.Completion X`.

In later files once the additive group structure is set up, we provide
* `UniformSpace.Completion.DistribMulAction`
* `UniformSpace.Completion.MulActionWithZero`
* `UniformSpace.Completion.Module`

TODO: Generalise the results here from the concrete `Completion` to any `AbstractCompletion`.
