# Infinite sum and product over a topological monoid

This file defines unconditionally convergent sums over a commutative topological additive monoid.
For Euclidean spaces (finite-dimensional Banach spaces) this is equivalent to absolute
convergence.

We also define unconditionally convergent products over a commutative topological multiplicative
monoid.

Note: There are summable sequences which are not unconditionally convergent! The other way holds
generally, see `HasSum.tendsto_sum_nat`.

## Implementation notes

We say that a function `f : β → α` has an unconditional product of `a` if the function
`fun s : Finset β ↦ ∏ b ∈ s, f b` converges to `a` on the `atTop` filter on `Finset β`. In other
words, for every neighborhood `U` of `a`, there exists a finite set `s : Finset β` of indices such
that `∏ b ∈ s', f b ∈ U` for any finite set `s'` which is a superset of `s`.

This may yield some unexpected results. For example, according to this definition, the product
`∏' n : ℕ, (1 : ℝ) / 2` unconditionally exists and is equal to `0`. More strikingly,
the product `∏' n : ℕ, (n : ℝ)` unconditionally exists and is equal to `0`, because one
of its terms is `0` (even though the product of the remaining terms diverges). Users who would
prefer that these products be considered not to exist can carry them out in the unit group `ℝˣ`
rather than in `ℝ`.

/- **NOTE**. This file is intended to be kept short, just enough to state the basic definitions and
six key lemmas relating them together, namely `Summable.hasSum`, `Multipliable.hasProd`,
`HasSum.tsum_eq`, `HasProd.tprod_eq`, `Summable.hasSum_iff`, and `Multipliable.hasProd_iff`.

Do not add further lemmas here -- add them to `InfiniteSum.Basic` or (preferably) another, more
specific file. -/

/-- `HasProd f a` means that the (potentially infinite) product of the `f b` for `b : β` converges
to `a`.

The `atTop` filter on `Finset β` is the limit of all finite sets towards the entire type. So we take
the product over bigger and bigger sets. This product operation is invariant under reordering.

For the definition and many statements, `α` does not need to be a topological monoid. We only add
this assumption later, for the lemmas where it is relevant.

These are defined in an identical way to infinite sums (`HasSum`). For example, we say that
the function `ℕ → ℝ` sending `n` to `1 / 2` has a product of `0`, rather than saying that it does
not converge as some authors would. -/

converges to `a`.

The `atTop` filter on `Finset β` is the limit of all finite sets towards the entire type. So we sum
up bigger and bigger sets. This sum operation is invariant under reordering. In particular,
the function `ℕ → ℝ` sending `n` to `(-1)^n / (n+1)` does not have a
sum for this definition, but a series which is absolutely convergent will have the correct sum.
