# Infinite sums and products in nonarchimedean abelian groups

Let `G` be a complete nonarchimedean abelian group and let `f : Œ± ‚Üí G` be a function. We prove that
`f` is unconditionally summable if and only if `f a` tends to zero on the cofinite filter on `Œ±`.
We also prove the analogous result in the multiplicative setting.
