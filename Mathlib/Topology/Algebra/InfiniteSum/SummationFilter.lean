# Summation filters

We define a `SummationFilter` on `β` to be a filter on the finite subsets of `β`. These are used
in defining summability: if `L` is a summation filter, we define the `L`-sum of `f` to be the
limit along `L` of the sums over finsets (if this limit exists). This file only develops the basic
machinery of summation filters - the key definitions `HasSum`, `tsum` and `summable` (and their
product variants) are in the file `Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.InfiniteSum.Defs`.
