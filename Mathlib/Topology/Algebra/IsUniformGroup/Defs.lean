# Uniform structure on topological groups

This file defines uniform groups and its additive counterpart. These typeclasses should be
preferred over using `[TopologicalSpace α] [IsTopologicalGroup α]` since every topological
group naturally induces a uniform structure.

## Main declarations
* `IsUniformGroup` and `IsUniformAddGroup`: Multiplicative and additive uniform groups,
  i.e., groups with uniformly continuous `(*)` and `(⁻¹)` / `(+)` and `(-)`.

## Main results

* `IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace` and `comm_topologicalAddGroup_is_uniform` can be used
  to construct a canonical uniformity for a topological additive group.

See `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/IsUniformGroup/Basic.lean` for further results.
