### Lattice of group topologies

We define a type class `GroupTopology α` which endows a group `α` with a topology such that all
group operations are continuous.

Group topologies on a fixed group `α` are ordered, by reverse inclusion. They form a complete
lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology and `⊤` the indiscrete topology.

Any function `f : α → β` induces `coinduced f : TopologicalSpace α → GroupTopology β`.

The additive version `AddGroupTopology α` and corresponding results are provided as well.
