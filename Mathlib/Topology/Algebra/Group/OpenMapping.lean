/-! # Open mapping theorem for morphisms of topological groups

We prove that a continuous surjective group morphism from a sigma-compact group to a locally compact
group is automatically open, in `MonoidHom.isOpenMap_of_sigmaCompact`.

We deduce this from a similar statement for the orbits of continuous actions of sigma-compact groups
on Baire spaces, given in `isOpenMap_smul_of_sigmaCompact`.

  /- Consider a small closed neighborhood `V` of the identity. Then the group is covered by
  countably many translates of `V`, say `gᵢ V`. Let also `Kₙ` be a sequence of compact sets covering
  the space. Then the image of `Kₙ ∩ gᵢ V` in the orbit is compact, and their unions covers the
  space. By Baire, one of them has nonempty interior. Then `gᵢ V • x` has nonempty interior, and
  so does `V • x`. Its interior contains a point `g' x` with `g' ∈ V`. Then `g'⁻¹ • V • x` contains
  a neighborhood of `x`, and it is included in `V⁻¹ • V • x`, which is itself contained in `U • x`
  if `V` is small enough. -/
