# Topological groups

This file defines the following typeclasses:

* `TopologicalGroup`, `TopologicalAddGroup`: multiplicative and additive topological groups,
  i.e., groups with continuous `(*)` and `(⁻¹)` / `(+)` and `(-)`;

* `ContinuousSub G` means that `G` has a continuous subtraction operation.

There is an instance deducing `ContinuousSub` from `TopologicalGroup` but we use a separate
typeclass because, e.g., `ℕ` and `ℝ≥0` have continuous subtraction but are not additive groups.

We also define `Homeomorph` versions of several `Equiv`s: `Homeomorph.mulLeft`,
`Homeomorph.mulRight`, `Homeomorph.inv`, and prove a few facts about neighbourhood filters in
groups.

### Topological groups

A topological group is a group in which the multiplication and inversion operations are
continuous. Topological additive groups are defined in the same way. Equivalently, we can require
that the division operation `x y ↦ x * y⁻¹` (resp., subtraction) is continuous.

/-! One may expect a version of `IsClosed.smul_left_of_isCompact` where `t` is compact and `s` is
closed, but such a lemma can't be true in this level of generality. For a counterexample, consider
`ℚ` acting on `ℝ` by translation, and let `s : Set ℚ := univ`, `t : set ℝ := {0}`. Then `s` is
closed and `t` is compact, but `s +ᵥ t` is the set of all rationals, which is definitely not
closed in `ℝ`.
To fix the proof, we would need to make two additional assumptions:
- for any `x ∈ t`, `s • {x}` is closed
- for any `x ∈ t`, there is a continuous function `g : s • {x} → s` such that, for all
  `y ∈ s • {x}`, we have `y = (g y) • x`
These are fairly specific hypotheses so we don't state this version of the lemmas, but an
interesting fact is that these two assumptions are verified in the case of a `NormedAddTorsor`
(or really, any `AddTorsor` with continuous `-ᵥ`). We prove this special case in
`IsClosed.vadd_right_of_isCompact`. -/

### Lattice of group topologies

We define a type class `GroupTopology α` which endows a group `α` with a topology such that all
group operations are continuous.

Group topologies on a fixed group `α` are ordered, by reverse inclusion. They form a complete
lattice, with `⊥` the discrete topology and `⊤` the indiscrete topology.

Any function `f : α → β` induces `coinduced f : TopologicalSpace α → GroupTopology β`.

The additive version `AddGroupTopology α` and corresponding results are provided as well.
