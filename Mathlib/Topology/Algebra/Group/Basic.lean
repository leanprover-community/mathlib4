# Topological groups

This file defines the following typeclasses:

* `IsTopologicalGroup`, `IsTopologicalAddGroup`: multiplicative and additive topological groups,
  i.e., groups with continuous `(*)` and `(⁻¹)` / `(+)` and `(-)`;

* `ContinuousSub G` means that `G` has a continuous subtraction operation.

There is an instance deducing `ContinuousSub` from `IsTopologicalGroup` but we use a separate
typeclass because, e.g., `ℕ` and `ℝ≥0` have continuous subtraction but are not additive groups.

We also define `Homeomorph` versions of several `Equiv`s: `Homeomorph.mulLeft`,
`Homeomorph.mulRight`, `Homeomorph.inv`, and prove a few facts about neighbourhood filters in
groups.

### Topological groups

A topological group is a group in which the multiplication and inversion operations are
continuous. Topological additive groups are defined in the same way. Equivalently, we can require
that the division operation `x y ↦ x * y⁻¹` (resp., subtraction) is continuous.
