# Closed subgroups of a topological group

This files builds the frame of closed subgroups in a topological group `G`,
and its additive version `ClosedAddSubgroup`.

# Main definitions and results

* `normalCore_isClosed` : The `normalCore` of a closed subgroup is closed.

* `finindex_closedSubgroup_isOpen` : A closed subgroup with finite index is open.

## TODO

Actually provide the `Order.Frame (ClosedSubgroup G)` instance.
