# Topological (sub)algebras

A topological algebra over a topological semiring `R` is a topological semiring with a compatible
continuous scalar multiplication by elements of `R`. We reuse typeclass `ContinuousSMul` for
topological algebras.

## Results

This is just a minimal stub for now!

The topological closure of a subalgebra is still a subalgebra,
which as an algebra is a topological algebra.
