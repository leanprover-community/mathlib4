# Completion of topological groups:

This files endows the completion of a topological abelian group with a group structure.
More precisely the instance `UniformSpace.Completion.addGroup` builds an abelian group structure
on the completion of an abelian group endowed with a compatible uniform structure.
Then the instance `UniformSpace.Completion.uniformAddGroup` proves this group structure is
compatible with the completed uniform structure. The compatibility condition is `UniformAddGroup`.

## Main declarations:

Beyond the instances explained above (that don't have to be explicitly invoked),
the main constructions deal with continuous group morphisms.

* `MonoidHom.extension`: extends a continuous group morphism from `G`
  to a complete separated group `H` to `Completion G`.
* `MonoidHom.completion`: promotes a continuous group morphism
  from `G` to `H` into a continuous group morphism
  from `Completion G` to `Completion H`.
