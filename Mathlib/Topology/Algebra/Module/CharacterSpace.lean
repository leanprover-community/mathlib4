# Character space of a topological algebra

The character space of a topological algebra is the subset of elements of the weak dual that
are also algebra homomorphisms. This space is used in the Gelfand transform, which gives an
isomorphism between a commutative C⋆-algebra and continuous functions on the character space
of the algebra. This, in turn, is used to construct the continuous functional calculus on
C⋆-algebras.


## Implementation notes

We define `WeakDual.characterSpace 𝕜 A` as a subset of the weak dual, which automatically puts the
correct topology on the space. We then define `WeakDual.CharacterSpace.toAlgHom` which provides the
algebra homomorphism corresponding to any element. We also provide `WeakDual.CharacterSpace.toCLM`
which provides the element as a continuous linear map. (Even though `WeakDual 𝕜 A` is a type copy of
`A →L[𝕜] 𝕜`, this is often more convenient.)
