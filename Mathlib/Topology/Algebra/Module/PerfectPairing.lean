# Continuous perfect pairings

This file defines continuous perfect pairings.

For a topological ring `R` and two topological modules `M` and `N`, a continuous perfect pairing is
a continuous bilinear map `M × N → R` that is bijective in both arguments.

We require continuity in the forward direction only so that we can put several different topologies
on the continuous dual (e.g., strong, weak, weak-*). For example, if `M` is weakly reflexive then
there is a continuous perfect pairing between `M` and `WeakDual R M`, even though the map
`WeakDual R M ≃ₗ[R] (M →L[R] R)` (where `M →L[R] R` is equipped with its strong topology) is not in
general a homeomorphism.

## TODO

Adapt `PerfectPairing` to this Prop-valued typeclass paradigm
