# An "action topology" for modules over a topological ring

If `R` is a topological group (or even just a topological space) acting on an additive
abelian group `A`, we define the *action topology* to be the finest topology on `A`
making `• : R × A → A` and `+ : A × A → A` continuous (with all the products having the
product topology).

This topology was suggested by Will Sawin [here](https://mathoverflow.net/a/477763/1384).

## Mathematical details

I (buzzard) don't know of any reference for this other than Sawin's mathoverflow answer,
so I expand some of the details here.

First note that there *is* a finest topology with this property! Indeed, topologies on a fixed
type form a complete lattice (infinite infs and sups exist). So if `τ` is the Inf of all
the topologies on `A` which make `+` and `•` continuous, then the claim is that `+` and `•`
are still continuous for `τ` (note that topologies are ordered so that finer topologies
are smaller). To show `+ : A × A → A` is continuous we equivalently need to show
that the pushforward of the product topology `τ × τ` along `+` is `≤ τ`, and because `τ` is
the greatest lower bound of the topologies making `•` and `+` continuous,
it suffices to show that it's `≤ σ` for any topology `σ` on `A` which makes `+` and `•` continuous.
However pushforward and products are monotone, so `τ × τ ≤ σ × σ`, and the pushforward of
`σ × σ` is `≤ σ` because that's precisely the statement that `+` is continuous for `σ`.
The proof for `•` follows mutatis mutandis.

A *topological module* for a topological ring `R` is an `R`-module `A` with a topology
making `+` and `•` continuous. The discussion so far has shown that the action topology makes `A`
into a topological module, and moreover is the finest topology with this property.

A crucial observation is that if `M` is a topological `R`-module, if `A` is an `R`-module with no
topology, and if `φ : A → M` is linear, then the pullback of `M`'s topology to `A` is a topology
making `A` into a topological module. Let's for example check that `•` is continuous.
If `U ⊆ A` is open then by definition of the pullback topology, `U = φ⁻¹(V)` for some open `V ⊆ M`,
and now the pullback of `U` under `•` is just the pullback along the continuous map
`id × φ : R × A → R × M` of the preimage of `V` under the continuous map `• : R × M → M`,
so it's open. The proof for `+` is similar.

As a consequence of this, we see that if `φ : A → M` is a linear map between topological `R`-modules
modules and if `A` has the action topology, then `φ` is automatically continuous.
Indeed the argument above shows that if `A → M` is linear then the action
topology on `A` is `≤` the pullback of the action topology on `M` (because it's the inf of a set
containing this topology) which is the definition of continuity.

We also deduce that the action topology is a functor from the category of `R`-modules
(`R` a topological ring) to the category of topological `R`-modules, and it is perhaps
unsurprising that this is an adjoint to the forgetful functor. Indeed, if `A` is an `R`-module
and `M` is a topological `R`-module, then the previous paragraph shows that
the linear maps `A → M` are precisely the continuous linear maps
from (`A` with its action topology) to `M`, so the action topology is a left adjoint
to the forgetful functor.

This file develops the theory of the action topology. We prove that the action topology on
`R` as a module over itself is `R`'s original topology, and that the action topology
is isomorphism-invariant.

## Main theorems

* `ActionTopology.instSelf : IsActionTopology R R`. The action topology on `R` is `R`'s topology.
* `ActionTopology.iso [IsActionTopology R A] (e : A ≃L[R] B) : IsActionTopology R B`. If `A` and
    `B` are `R`-modules with topologies, if `e` is a topological isomorphism between them,
    and if `A` has the action topology, then `B` has the action topology.

## TODO

Forthcoming PRs from the FLT repo will show that the action topology on a (binary or finite) product
of modules is the product of the action topologies, and that the action topology on the quotient
of a module `M` is the quotient topology when `M` is equipped with the action topology.

We will also show the slightly more subtle result that if `M`, `N` and `P` are `R`-modules
equipped with the action topology and if furthermore `M` is finite as an `R`-module,
then any bilinear map `M × N → P` is continuous.

As a consequence of this, we deduce that if `R` is a commutative topological ring
and `A` is an `R`-algebra of finite type as `R`-module, then `A` with its action
topology becomes a topological ring (i.e., multiplication is continuous).

Other TODOs (not done in the FLT repo):

* The action topology is a functor from the category of `R`-modules
  to the category of topological `R`-modules, and it's an adjoint to the forgetful functor.
