# Continuous linear maps and quotient topological modules

In this file, we collect various continuous linear maps associated to quotient spaces.

## Main definitions

* `Submodule.mkQL S` is the quotient map `M →L[R] M ⧸ S`. In other words, it is
  `Submodule.mkQ S` bundled as a `ContinuousLinearMap`.
* `Submodule.liftQL S f h` is the map `M ⧸ S →SL[σ] N` given by `f : M →SL[σ] N` and a proof
  `h : S ≤ f.ker` that `f` vanishes on `S`. In other words, it is `Submodule.liftQ S f h` bundled
  as a `ContinuousLinearMap`.

## TODO

* Define `Submodule.mapQL`, the continuous linear bundling of `Submodule.mapQ`.
