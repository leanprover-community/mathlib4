# Weak dual topology

This file defines the weak topology given two vector spaces `E` and `F` over a commutative semiring
`𝕜` and a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜`. The weak topology on `E` is the coarsest topology
such that for all `y : F` every map `fun x => B x y` is continuous.

## Main definitions

The main definition is the type `WeakBilin B`.

* Given `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜`, the type `WeakBilin B` is a type synonym for `E`.
* The instance `WeakBilin.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak topology induced by the bilinear form
  `B`.

## Main results

We establish that `WeakBilin B` has the following structure:
* `WeakBilin.instContinuousAdd`: The addition in `WeakBilin B` is continuous.
* `WeakBilin.instContinuousSMul`: The scalar multiplication in `WeakBilin B` is continuous.

We prove the following results characterizing the weak topology:
* `eval_continuous`: For any `y : F`, the evaluation mapping `fun x => B x y` is continuous.
* `continuous_of_continuous_eval`: For a mapping to `WeakBilin B` to be continuous,
  it suffices that its compositions with pairing with `B` at all points `y : F` is continuous.
* `tendsto_iff_forall_eval_tendsto`: Convergence in `WeakBilin B` can be characterized
  in terms of convergence of the evaluations at all points `y : F`.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.
