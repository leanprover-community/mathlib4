# A linear map which is locally an embedding is an embedding

Fix `𝕜` a `NontriviallyNormedField`, `E`, `F` two topological vector spaces over `𝕜`, and
`f : E → F` a `𝕜`-linear map. We show that, if there is a neighborhood `V` of `0 : E`
such that the restriction `V → F` is an embedding, then `f` itself is an embedding.

Note that this result is false for topological groups, as shown by the following counterexamples:
* first, in the group setting, there are local embeddings (even local homeomorphisms) which
  are not globally injective; an example is the quotient map `ℝ → 𝕋 := ℝ ⧸ ℤ`;
* even if assume that `f` is globally injective, the theorem still fails. Consider for example
  `f : ℝ → 𝕋 × 𝕋` given by `x ↦ ([x], [α * x])`, with `α` irrational. `f` is injective, and locally
  an embedding by the inverse function theorem, yet it is not globally an embedding: any
  neighborhood of `f(0) = (0, 0)` contains infinitely many points `f(n)`, `n ∈ ℤ`, since
  `α * n` gets arbitrarily close to being an integer infinitely many times.

## Main results

* `ContinuousSMul.topology_eq_of_induced_eq`: let `t₁`, `t₂` be two vector space
  topologies on `E`, and assume that there is a `t₁`-neighborhood of 0 `V` in restriction to
  which the two topologies coincide. Then `t₁ = t₂`.
* `LinearMap.isInducing_of_restrict_nhds_zero`: consider a linear map `f : E → F`, and assume
  there is a neighborhood of 0 `V` in `E` such that `V.domRestrict f : V → F` satisfies
  `Topology.IsInducing`. Then `f` satisfies `Topology.IsInducing`.
* `LinearMap.isEmbedding_of_restrict_nhds_zero`: consider a linear map `f : E → F`, and assume
  there is a neighborhood of 0 `V` in `E` such that `V.domRestrict f : V → F` is a topological
  embedding. Then `f` is a topological embedding.

## TODO

We will also need the fact that if the restriction `V → F` is a *closed* embedding, then
`f : E → F` is a *closed* embedding. This will follow from the fact that a subgroup which is
locally closed at `0` is in fact closed, which we don't have yet

## Implementation details

The content of this file is essentially (variations of)
[N. Bourbaki, *Théories Spectrales*, Chapitre III, § 5, n° 1, lemme 1][bourbaki2023], except
Bourbaki's proof is very specific to `𝕜 = ℝ` or `𝕜 = ℂ`, since it relies crucially on balanced
sets being connected.

Nevertheless, we are able to adapt their proof to arbitrary nontrivially normed fields.
The key argument, replacing the fact that a connected set cannot be covered nontrivially by
disjoint open sets, is that a balanced set `W` cannot intersect nontrivially both `c • V`
and `Vᶜ`, when `V` is a neighborhood of `0` and `0 < ‖c‖ < 1`. We refer to the (highly commented!)
proof for more details.
