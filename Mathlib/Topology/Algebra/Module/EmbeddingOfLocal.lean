/-- Let `V` be an absorbent set in a vector space, and fix a "scale" `c : 𝕜` with `0 < ‖c‖ < 1`.
Then, we can build a retraction `p : E → V` such that:
* if `x` is outside of `V`, then `p x` is outside of `c • V`.
* for *any* topology on `E` compatible with the vector space structure, `p` is continuous at zero.
