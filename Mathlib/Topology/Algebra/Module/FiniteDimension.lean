# Finite-dimensional topological vector spaces over complete fields

Let `𝕜` be a complete nontrivially normed field, and `E` a topological vector space (TVS) over
`𝕜` (i.e we have `[AddCommGroup E] [Module 𝕜 E] [TopologicalSpace E] [IsTopologicalAddGroup E]`
and `[ContinuousSMul 𝕜 E]`).

If `E` is finite dimensional and Hausdorff, then all linear maps from `E` to any other TVS are
continuous.

When `E` is a normed space, this gets us the equivalence of norms in finite dimension.

## Main results :

* `LinearMap.continuous_iff_isClosed_ker` : a linear form is continuous if and only if its kernel
  is closed.
* `LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional` : a linear map on a finite-dimensional Hausdorff
  space over a complete field is continuous.

## TODO

Generalize more of `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Module/FiniteDimension.lean` to general TVSs.

## Implementation detail

The main result from which everything follows is the fact that, if `ξ : ι → E` is a finite basis,
then `ξ.equivFun : E →ₗ (ι → 𝕜)` is continuous. However, for technical reasons, it is easier to
prove this when `ι` and `E` live in the same universe. So we start by doing that as a private
lemma, then we deduce `LinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional` from it, and then the general
result follows as `continuous_equivFun_basis`.
