# Weak dual topology

We continue in the setting of `Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.Module.WeakBilin`,
which defines the weak topology given two vector spaces `E` and `F` over a commutative semiring
`𝕜` and a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜`. The weak topology on `E` is the coarsest topology
such that for all `y : F` every map `fun x => B x y` is continuous.

In this file, we consider two special cases.
In the case that `F = E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` and `B` being the canonical pairing, we obtain the weak-* topology,
`WeakDual 𝕜 E := (E →L[𝕜] 𝕜)`. Interchanging the arguments in the bilinear form yields the
weak topology `WeakSpace 𝕜 E := E`.

## Main definitions

The main definitions are the types `WeakDual 𝕜 E` and `WeakSpace 𝕜 E`,
with the respective topology instances on it.

* `WeakDual 𝕜 E` is a type synonym for `Dual 𝕜 E` (when the latter is defined): both are equal to
  the type `E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` of continuous linear maps from a module `E` over `𝕜` to the ring `𝕜`.
* The instance `WeakDual.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak-* topology on `WeakDual 𝕜 E`, i.e., the
  coarsest topology making the evaluation maps at all `z : E` continuous.
* `WeakSpace 𝕜 E` is a type synonym for `E` (when the latter is defined).
* The instance `WeakSpace.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak topology on `E`, i.e., the
  coarsest topology such that all `v : dual 𝕜 E` remain continuous.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.
