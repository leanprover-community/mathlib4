# Weak dual topology

This file defines the weak topology given two vector spaces `E` and `F` over a commutative semiring
`𝕜` and a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜`. The weak topology on `E` is the coarsest topology
such that for all `y : F` every map `fun x => B x y` is continuous.

In the case that `F = E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` and `B` being the canonical pairing, we obtain the weak-* topology,
`WeakDual 𝕜 E := (E →L[𝕜] 𝕜)`. Interchanging the arguments in the bilinear form yields the
weak topology `WeakSpace 𝕜 E := E`.

## Main definitions

The main definitions are the types `WeakBilin B` for the general case and the two special cases
`WeakDual 𝕜 E` and `WeakSpace 𝕜 E` with the respective topology instances on it.

* Given `B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜`, the type `WeakBilin B` is a type synonym for `E`.
* The instance `WeakBilin.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak topology induced by the bilinear form
  `B`.
* `WeakDual 𝕜 E` is a type synonym for `Dual 𝕜 E` (when the latter is defined): both are equal to
  the type `E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` of continuous linear maps from a module `E` over `𝕜` to the ring `𝕜`.
* The instance `WeakDual.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak-* topology on `WeakDual 𝕜 E`, i.e., the
  coarsest topology making the evaluation maps at all `z : E` continuous.
* `WeakSpace 𝕜 E` is a type synonym for `E` (when the latter is defined).
* The instance `WeakSpace.instTopologicalSpace` is the weak topology on `E`, i.e., the
  coarsest topology such that all `v : dual 𝕜 E` remain continuous.

## Main results

We establish that `WeakBilin B` has the following structure:
* `WeakBilin.instContinuousAdd`: The addition in `WeakBilin B` is continuous.
* `WeakBilin.instContinuousSMul`: The scalar multiplication in `WeakBilin B` is continuous.

We prove the following results characterizing the weak topology:
* `eval_continuous`: For any `y : F`, the evaluation mapping `fun x => B x y` is continuous.
* `continuous_of_continuous_eval`: For a mapping to `WeakBilin B` to be continuous,
  it suffices that its compositions with pairing with `B` at all points `y : F` is continuous.
* `tendsto_iff_forall_eval_tendsto`: Convergence in `WeakBilin B` can be characterized
  in terms of convergence of the evaluations at all points `y : F`.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.
