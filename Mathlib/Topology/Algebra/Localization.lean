# Localization of topological rings

The topological localization of a topological commutative ring `R` at a submonoid `M` is the ring
`Localization M` endowed with the final ring topology of the natural homomorphism sending `x : R`
to the equivalence class of `(x, 1)` in the localization of `R` at an `M`.

## Main Results

- `Localization.ringTopology`: The localization of a topological commutative ring at a submonoid
  is a topological ring.
