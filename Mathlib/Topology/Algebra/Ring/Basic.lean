# Topological (semi)rings

A topological (semi)ring is a (semi)ring equipped with a topology such that all operations are
continuous. Besides this definition, this file proves that the topological closure of a subring
(resp. an ideal) is a subring (resp. an ideal) and defines products and quotients
of topological (semi)rings.

## Main Results

- `Subring.topologicalClosure`/`Subsemiring.topologicalClosure`: the topological closure of a
  `Subring`/`Subsemiring` is itself a `Sub(semi)ring`.
- The product of two topological (semi)rings is a topological (semi)ring.
- The indexed product of topological (semi)rings is a topological (semi)ring.

/-- a topological semiring is a semiring `R` where addition and multiplication are continuous.
We allow for non-unital and non-associative semirings as well.

The `TopologicalSemiring` class should *only* be instantiated in the presence of a
`NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring` instance; if there is an instance of `NonUnitalNonAssocRing`,
then `TopologicalRing` should be used. Note: in the presence of `NonAssocRing`, these classes are
mathematically equivalent (see `TopologicalSemiring.continuousNeg_of_mul` or
`TopologicalSemiring.toTopologicalRing`). -/

### Lattice of ring topologies
We define a type class `RingTopology α` which endows a ring `α` with a topology such that all ring
operations are continuous.

Ring topologies on a fixed ring `α` are ordered, by reverse inclusion. They form a complete lattice,
with `⊥` the discrete topology and `⊤` the indiscrete topology.

Any function `f : α → β` induces `coinduced f : TopologicalSpace α → RingTopology β`. -/
