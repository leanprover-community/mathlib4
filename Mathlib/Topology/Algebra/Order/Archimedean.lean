# Topology on archimedean groups and fields

In this file we prove the following theorems:

- `Rat.denseRange_cast`: the coercion from `ℚ` to a linear ordered archimedean field has dense
  range;

- `AddSubgroup.dense_of_not_isolated_zero`, `AddSubgroup.dense_of_no_min`: two sufficient conditions
  for a subgroup of an archimedean linear ordered additive commutative group to be dense;

- `AddSubgroup.dense_or_cyclic`: an additive subgroup of an archimedean linear ordered additive
  commutative group `G` with order topology either is dense in `G` or is a cyclic subgroup.
