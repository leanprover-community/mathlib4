# Topological monoids - definitions

In this file we define two mixin typeclasses:

- `ContinuousMul M` says that the multiplication on `M` is continuous as a function on `M × M`;
- `ContinuousAdd M` says that the addition on `M` is continuous as a function on `M × M`.

These classes are `Prop`-valued mixins,
i.e., they take data (`TopologicalSpace`, `Mul`/`Add`) as arguments
instead of extending typeclasses with these fields.

We also provide convenience dot notation lemmas like `Filter.Tendsto.mul` and `ContinuousAt.add`.

/-- Basic hypothesis to talk about a topological additive monoid or a topological additive
semigroup. A topological additive monoid over `M`, for example, is obtained by requiring both the
instances `AddMonoid M` and `ContinuousAdd M`.

Continuity in only the left/right argument can be stated using
`ContinuousConstVAdd α α`/`ContinuousConstVAdd αᵐᵒᵖ α`. -/
