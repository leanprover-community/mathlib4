# Restricted products of sets, groups and rings, and their topology

We define the **restricted product** of `R : ι → Type*` of types, relative to
a family of subsets `A : (i : ι) → Set (R i)` and a filter `𝓕 : Filter ι`. This
is the set of all `x : Π i, R i` such that the set `{j | x j ∈ A j}` belongs to `𝓕`.
We denote it by `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`.

The main case of interest, which we shall refer to as the "classical restricted product",
is that of `𝓕 = cofinite`. Recall that this is the filter of all subsets of `ι`, which are
*cofinite* in the sense that they have finite complement.
Hence, the associated restricted product is the set of all `x : Π i, R i` such that
`x j ∈ A j` for all but finitely many `j`s. We denote it simply by `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`.

Another notable case is that of the principal filter `𝓕 = 𝓟 s` corresponding to some subset `s`
of `ι`. The associated restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` is the set of all
`x : Π i, R i` such that `x j ∈ A j` for all `j ∈ s`. Put another way, this is just
`(Π i ∈ s, A i) × (Π i ∉ s, R i)`, modulo the obvious isomorphism.

We endow these types with the obvious algebraic structures, as well as their natural topology,
which we describe below. We also show various compatibility results.

In particular, with the theory of adeles in mind, we show that if each `R i` is a locally compact
topological ring with open subring `A i`, and if all but finitely many of the `A i`s are also
compact, then `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is a locally compact topological ring.

## Main definitions

* `RestrictedProduct`: the restricted product of a family `R` of types, relative to a family `A` of
  subsets and a filter `𝓕` on the indexing set. This is denoted `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`,
  or simply `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` when `𝓕 = cofinite`.
* `RestrictedProduct.instDFunLike`: interpret an element of `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` as an element
  of `Π i, R i` using the `DFunLike` machinery.
* `RestrictedProduct.structureMap`: the inclusion map from `Π i, A i` to `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`.
* `RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace`: the `TopologicalSpace` instance on `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`.

## Topology on the restricted product

The topology on the restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is defined in the following way:
1. If `𝓕` is some principal filter `𝓟 s`, recall that `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` is canonically
identified with `(Π i ∈ s, A i) × (Π i ∉ s, R i)`. We endow it with the product topology,
which is also the topology induced from the full product `Π i, R i`.
2. In general, we note that `𝓕` is the infimum of the principal filters coarser than `𝓕`. We
then endow `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` with the inductive limit / final topology associated to the
inclusion maps `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s] → Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` where `𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 s`.

In particular:
* On the classical restricted product, with respect to the cofinite filter, this corresponds to
  taking the inductive limit of the `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` over all *cofinite* sets `s : Set ι`.
* If `𝓕 = 𝓟 s` is a principal filter, this second step clearly does not change the topology, since
  `s` belongs to the indexing set of the inductive limit.

Taking advantage of that second remark, we do not actually declare an instance specific to
principal filters. Instead, we provide directly the general instance (corresponding to step 2 above)
as `RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace`. We then prove that, for a principal filter, the
map to the full product is an inducing (`RestrictedProduct.isEmbedding_coe_of_principal`),
and that the topology for a general `𝓕` is indeed the expected inductive limit
(`RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace_eq_iSup`).

## Main statements

* `RestrictedProduct.isEmbedding_coe_of_principal`: for any set `S`, `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]`
  is endowed with the subset topology coming from `Π i, R i`.
* `RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace_eq_iSup`: the topology on `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is the
  inductive limit / final topology associated to the natural maps
  `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S] → Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`, where `𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 S`.
* `RestrictedProduct.continuous_dom`: a map from `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is continuous
*if and only if* its restriction to each `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` (with `𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 s`) is continuous.
* `RestrictedProduct.continuous_dom_prod_left`: assume that each `A i` is an **open** subset of
`R i`. Then, for any topological space `Y`, a map from `Y × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is continuous
*if and only if* its restriction to each `Y × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]` (with `S` cofinite)
is continuous.

* `RestrictedProduct.isTopologicalGroup`: if each `R i` is a topological group and each `A i` is an
  open subgroup of `R i`, then `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is a topological group.
* `RestrictedProduct.isTopologicalRing`: if each `R i` is a topological ring and each `A i` is an
  open subring of `R i`, then `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is a topological ring.
* `RestrictedProduct.continuousSMul`: if some topological monoid `G` acts on each `M i`, and each
  `A i` is stable for that action, then the natural action of `G` on `Πʳ i, [M i, A i]` is also
  continuous. In particular, if each `M i` is a topological `R`-module and each `A i` is an open
  sub-`R`-module of `M i`, then `Πʳ i, [M i, A i]` is a topological `R`-module.

* `RestrictedProduct.weaklyLocallyCompactSpace_of_cofinite`:  if each `R i` is weakly locally
  compact, each `A i` is open, and all but finitely many `A i`s are also compact, then the
  restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is weakly locally compact.
* `RestrictedProduct.locallyCompactSpace_of_group`: assume that each `R i` is a locally compact
  group with `A i` an open subgroup. Assume also that all but finitely many `A i`s are compact.
  Then the restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is a locally compact group.

## Notation

* `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is `RestrictedProduct R A 𝓕`.
* `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]` is `RestrictedProduct R A cofinite`.

## Implementation details

Outside of principal filters and the cofinite filter, the topology we define on the restricted
product does not seem well-behaved. While declaring a single instance is practical, it may conflict
with more interesting topologies in some other cases. Thus, future contributions should not
restrain from specializing these instances to principal and cofinite filters if necessary.

/-- The **restricted product** of a family `R : ι → Type*` of types, relative to subsets
`A : (i : ι) → Set (R i)` and the filter `𝓕 : Filter ι`, is the set of all `x : Π i, R i`
such that the set `{j | x j ∈ A j}` belongs to `𝓕`. We denote it by `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]`.

The most common use case is with `𝓕 = cofinite`, in which case the restricted product is the set
of all `x : Π i, R i` such that `x j ∈ A j` for all but finitely many `j`. We denote it simply
by `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`.

Similarly, if `S` is a principal filter, the restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]`
is the set of all `x : Π i, R i` such that `∀ j ∈ S, x j ∈ A j`. -/

## Topology on the restricted product

The topology on the restricted product `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is defined in the following way:
1. If `𝓕` is some principal filter `𝓟 s`, recall that `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` is canonically
identified with `(Π i ∈ s, A i) × (Π i ∉ s, R i)`. We endow it with the product topology,
which is also the topology induced from the full product `Π i, R i`.
2. In general, we note that `𝓕` is the infimum of the principal filters coarser than `𝓕`. We
then endow `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` with the inductive limit / final topology associated to the
inclusion maps `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s] → Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` where `𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 s`.

In particular:
* On the classical restricted product, with respect to the cofinite filter, this corresponds to
  taking the inductive limit of the `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]` over all *cofinite* sets `s : Set ι`.
* If `𝓕 = 𝓟 s` is a principal filter, this second step clearly does not change the topology, since
  `s` belongs to the indexing set of the inductive limit.

Taking advantage of that second remark, we do not actually declare an instance specific to
principal filters. Instead, we provide directly the general instance (corresponding to step 2 above)
as `RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace`. We then prove that, for a principal filter, the
map to the full product is an inducing (`RestrictedProduct.isEmbedding_coe_of_principal`),
and that the topology for a general `𝓕` is indeed the expected inductive limit
(`RestrictedProduct.topologicalSpace_eq_iSup`).

Note: outside of these two cases, this topology on the restricted product does not seem
well-behaved. While declaring a single instance is practical, it may conflict with more interesting
topologies in some other cases. Thus, future contributions should not restrain from specializing
these instances to principal and cofinite filters if necessary.

### Topological facts in the case where `𝓕 = cofinite` and all `A i`s are open

The classical restricted product, associated to the cofinite filter, satisfies more topological
properties when each `A i` is an open subset of `R i`. The key fact is that each
`Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]` (with `S` cofinite) then embeds **as an open subset** in
`Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`.

This allows us to prove a "universal property with parameters", expressing that for any
arbitrary topolgical space `X` (of "parameters"), the product `X × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`
is still the inductive limit of the `X × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]` for `S` cofinite.

This fact, which is **not true** for a general inductive limit, will allow us to prove continuity
of functions of two variables (e.g algebraic operations), which would otherwise be inaccessible.
