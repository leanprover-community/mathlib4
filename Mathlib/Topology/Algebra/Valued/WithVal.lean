# Ring topologised by a valuation

For a given valuation `v : Valuation R Γ₀` on a ring `R` taking values in `Γ₀`, this file
defines the type synonym `WithVal v` of `R`. By assigning a `Valued (WithVal v) Γ₀` instance,
`WithVal v` represents the ring `R` equipped with the topology coming from `v`. The type
synonym `WithVal v` is in isomorphism to `R` as rings via `WithVal.equiv v`. This
isomorphism should be used to explicitly map terms of `WithVal v` to terms of `R`.

The `WithVal` type synonym is used to define the completion of `R` with respect to `v` in
`Valuation.Completion`. An example application of this is
`IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.adicCompletion`, which is the completion of the field of
fractions of a Dedekind domain with respect to a height-one prime ideal of the domain.

## Main definitions
 - `WithVal` : type synonym for a ring equipped with the topology coming from a valuation.
 - `WithVal.equiv` : the canonical ring equivalence between `WithValuation v` and `R`.
 - `Valuation.Completion` : the uniform space completion of a field `K` according to the
  uniform structure defined by the specified valuation.
