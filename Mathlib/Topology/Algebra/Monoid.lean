-- We register `Continuous.pow` as a `continuity` lemma with low penalty (so
-- `continuity` will try it before other `continuity` lemmas). This is a
-- workaround for goals of the form `Continuous fun x => x ^ 2`, where
-- `continuity` applies `Continuous.mul` since the goal is defeq to
-- `Continuous fun x => x * x`.
--
-- To properly fix this, we should make sure that `continuity` applies its
-- lemmas with reducible transparency, preventing the unfolding of `^`. But this
-- is quite an invasive change.
