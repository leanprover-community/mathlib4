# Category of Profinite Groups

We say `G` is a profinite group if it is a topological group which is compact and totally
disconnected.

## Main definitions and results

* `ProfiniteGrp` is the category of profinite groups.

* `ProfiniteGrp.pi` : The pi-type of profinite groups is also a profinite group.

* `ofFiniteGrp` : A `FiniteGrp` when given the discrete topology can be considered as a
  profinite group.
