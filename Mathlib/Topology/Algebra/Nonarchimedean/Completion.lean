    additive subgroup of `Completion G`. -/

    /- Since `Completion G` is regular, there is a closed neighborhood `C` of `0` which is
    contained in `U`. -/
    obtain ‚ü®C, ‚ü®hC, C_closed‚ü©, C_subset_U‚ü© := (closed_nhds_basis 0).mem_iff.mp hU

    /- Therefore, since `G` is nonarchimedean, there exists an open subgroup `W` of `G` that is
    contained within `toCompl ‚Åª¬π' C`. -/
    obtain ‚ü®W, hCW‚ü© := NonarchimedeanAddGroup.is_nonarchimedean (toCompl ‚Åª¬π' C) this

    `Completion G` and taking the topological closure. -/
    let V : Set (Completion G) := (W.map toCompl).topologicalClosure
    /- We claim that this set `V` satisfies the
    desired properties. There are three conditions to check:

    1. `V` is a subgroup of `Completion G`.
    2. `V` is open.
    3. `V ‚äÜ U`.

    The first condition follows directly from the fact that the topological closure of a subgroup
    is a subgroup. Now, let us check that `V` is open. -/
    have : IsOpen V := by
      /- Since `V` is a subgroup of `Completion G`, it suffices to show that it is a neighborhood of
      `0` in `Completion G`. This follows from the fact that `toCompl : G ‚Üí Completion G` is dense
      inducing and `W` is a neighborhood of `0` in `G`. -/

    /- Finally, it remains to show that `V ‚äÜ U`. It suffices to show that `V ‚äÜ C`, which
    follows from the fact that `W ‚äÜ toCompl ‚Åª¬π' C` and `C` is closed. -/
