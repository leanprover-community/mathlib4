# Instances related to the discrete topology

We prove that the discrete topology is
* first-countable,
* second-countable for an encodable type,
* equal to the order topology in linear orders which are also `PredOrder` and `SuccOrder`,
* metrizable.

When importing this file and `Data.Nat.SuccPred`, the instances `SecondCountableTopology ℕ`
and `OrderTopology ℕ` become available.
