# Additional lemmas about the topology on rational numbers

The structure of a metric space on `ℚ` (`Rat.MetricSpace`) is introduced elsewhere, induced from
`ℝ`. In this file we prove some properties of this topological space and its one-point
compactification.

## Main statements

- `Rat.TotallyDisconnectedSpace`: `ℚ` is a totally disconnected space;

- `Rat.not_countably_generated_nhds_infty_opc`: the filter of neighbourhoods of infinity in
  `OnePoint ℚ` is not countably generated.

## Notation

- `ℚ∞` is used as a local notation for `OnePoint ℚ`
