# Sequences in topological spaces

In this file we prove theorems about relations
between closure/compactness/continuity etc. and their sequential counterparts.

## Main definitions

The following notions are defined in `Topology/Defs/Sequences`.
We build theory about these definitions here, so we remind the definitions.

### Set operation
* `seqClosure s`: sequential closure of a set, the set of limits of sequences of points of `s`;

### Predicates

* `IsSeqClosed s`: predicate saying that a set is sequentially closed, i.e., `seqClosure s ⊆ s`;
* `SeqContinuous f`: predicate saying that a function is sequentially continuous, i.e.,
  for any sequence `u : ℕ → X` that converges to a point `x`, the sequence `f ∘ u` converges to
  `f x`;
* `IsSeqCompact s`: predicate saying that a set is sequentially compact, i.e., every sequence
  taking values in `s` has a converging subsequence.

### Type classes

* `FrechetUrysohnSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is a *Fréchet-Urysohn
  space*, i.e., the sequential closure of any set is equal to its closure.
* `SequentialSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is a *sequential space*, i.e.,
  any sequentially closed set in this space is closed. This condition is weaker than being a
  Fréchet-Urysohn space.
* `SeqCompactSpace X`: a typeclass saying that a topological space is sequentially compact, i.e.,
  every sequence in `X` has a converging subsequence.

## Main results

* `seqClosure_subset_closure`: closure of a set includes its sequential closure;
* `IsClosed.isSeqClosed`: a closed set is sequentially closed;
* `IsSeqClosed.seqClosure_eq`: sequential closure of a sequentially closed set `s` is equal
  to `s`;
* `seqClosure_eq_closure`: in a Fréchet-Urysohn space, the sequential closure of a set is equal to
  its closure;
* `tendsto_nhds_iff_seq_tendsto`, `FrechetUrysohnSpace.of_seq_tendsto_imp_tendsto`: a topological
  space is a Fréchet-Urysohn space if and only if sequential convergence implies convergence;
* `FirstCountableTopology.frechetUrysohnSpace`: every topological space with
  first countable topology is a Fréchet-Urysohn space;
* `FrechetUrysohnSpace.to_sequentialSpace`: every Fréchet-Urysohn space is a sequential space;
* `IsSeqCompact.isCompact`: a sequentially compact set in a uniform space with countably
  generated uniformity is compact.
