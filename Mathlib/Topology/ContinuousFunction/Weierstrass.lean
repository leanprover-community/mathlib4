# The Weierstrass approximation theorem for continuous functions on `[a,b]`

We've already proved the Weierstrass approximation theorem
in the sense that we've shown that the Bernstein approximations
to a continuous function on `[0,1]` converge uniformly.

Here we rephrase this more abstractly as
`polynomialFunctions_closure_eq_top' : (polynomialFunctions I).topologicalClosure = ‚ä§`
and then, by precomposing with suitable affine functions,
`polynomialFunctions_closure_eq_top : (polynomialFunctions (Set.Icc a b)).topologicalClosure = ‚ä§`

/-- The special case of the Weierstrass approximation theorem for the interval `[0,1]`.
This is just a matter of unravelling definitions and using the Bernstein approximations.

/-- The **Weierstrass Approximation Theorem**:
polynomials functions on `[a, b] ‚äÜ ‚Ñù` are dense in `C([a,b],‚Ñù)`

(While we could deduce this as an application of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem,
our proof of that relies on the fact that `abs` is in the closure of polynomials on `[-M, M]`,
so we may as well get this done first.)
