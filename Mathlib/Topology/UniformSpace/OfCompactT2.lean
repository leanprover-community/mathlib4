# Compact separated uniform spaces

## Main statement

* `uniformSpaceOfCompactR1`: every compact R1 topological structure is induced by a uniform
  structure. This uniform structure is described by `compactSpace_uniformity`.

## Implementation notes

The construction `uniformSpaceOfCompactR1` is not declared as an instance, as it would badly
loop.

        This is the difficult part of the proof. We need to prove that, for each neighborhood `W`
        of the diagonal `Δ`, there exists a smaller neighborhood `V` such that `V ○ V ⊆ W`.
