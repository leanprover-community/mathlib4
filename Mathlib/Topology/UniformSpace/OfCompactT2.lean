# Compact separated uniform spaces

## Main statement

* `uniformSpace_of_compact_t2`: every compact T2 topological structure is induced by a uniform
  structure. This uniform structure is described by `compactSpace_uniformity`.

## Implementation notes

The construction `uniformSpace_of_compact_t2` is not declared as an instance, as it would badly
loop.
