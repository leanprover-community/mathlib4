# Uniform spaces

Uniform spaces are a generalization of metric spaces and topological groups. Many concepts directly
generalize to uniform spaces, e.g.

* uniform continuity (in this file)
* completeness (in `Cauchy.lean`)
* extension of uniform continuous functions to complete spaces (in `IsUniformEmbedding.lean`)
* totally bounded sets (in `Cauchy.lean`)
* totally bounded complete sets are compact (in `Cauchy.lean`)

A uniform structure on a type `X` is a filter `𝓤 X` on `X × X` satisfying some conditions
which makes it reasonable to say that `∀ᶠ (p : X × X) in 𝓤 X, ...` means
"for all p.1 and p.2 in X close enough, ...". Elements of this filter are called entourages
of `X`. The two main examples are:

* If `X` is a metric space, `V ∈ 𝓤 X ↔ ∃ ε > 0, { p | dist p.1 p.2 < ε } ⊆ V`
* If `G` is an additive topological group, `V ∈ 𝓤 G ↔ ∃ U ∈ 𝓝 (0 : G), {p | p.2 - p.1 ∈ U} ⊆ V`

Those examples are generalizations in two different directions of the elementary example where
`X = ℝ` and `V ∈ 𝓤 ℝ ↔ ∃ ε > 0, { p | |p.2 - p.1| < ε } ⊆ V` which features both the topological
group structure on `ℝ` and its metric space structure.

Each uniform structure on `X` induces a topology on `X` characterized by

> `nhds_eq_comap_uniformity : ∀ {x : X}, 𝓝 x = comap (Prod.mk x) (𝓤 X)`

where `Prod.mk x : X → X × X := (fun y ↦ (x, y))` is the partial evaluation of the product
constructor.

The dictionary with metric spaces includes:
* an upper bound for `dist x y` translates into `(x, y) ∈ V` for some `V ∈ 𝓤 X`
* a ball `ball x r` roughly corresponds to `UniformSpace.ball x V := {y | (x, y) ∈ V}`
  for some `V ∈ 𝓤 X`, but the later is more general (it includes in
  particular both open and closed balls for suitable `V`).
  In particular we have:
  `isOpen_iff_ball_subset {s : Set X} : IsOpen s ↔ ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ V ∈ 𝓤 X, ball x V ⊆ s`

The triangle inequality is abstracted to a statement involving the composition of relations in `X`.
First note that the triangle inequality in a metric space is equivalent to
`∀ (x y z : X) (r r' : ℝ), dist x y ≤ r → dist y z ≤ r' → dist x z ≤ r + r'`.
Then, for any `V` and `W` with type `Set (X × X)`, the composition `V ○ W : Set (X × X)` is
defined as `{ p : X × X | ∃ z, (p.1, z) ∈ V ∧ (z, p.2) ∈ W }`.
In the metric space case, if `V = { p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r }` and `W = { p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r' }`
then the triangle inequality, as reformulated above, says `V ○ W` is contained in
`{p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r + r'}` which is the entourage associated to the radius `r + r'`.
In general we have `mem_ball_comp (h : y ∈ ball x V) (h' : z ∈ ball y W) : z ∈ ball x (V ○ W)`.
Note that this discussion does not depend on any axiom imposed on the uniformity filter,
it is simply captured by the definition of composition.

The uniform space axioms ask the filter `𝓤 X` to satisfy the following:
* every `V ∈ 𝓤 X` contains the diagonal `idRel = { p | p.1 = p.2 }`. This abstracts the fact
  that `dist x x ≤ r` for every non-negative radius `r` in the metric space case and also that
  `x - x` belongs to every neighborhood of zero in the topological group case.
* `V ∈ 𝓤 X → Prod.swap '' V ∈ 𝓤 X`. This is tightly related the fact that `dist x y = dist y x`
  in a metric space, and to continuity of negation in the topological group case.
* `∀ V ∈ 𝓤 X, ∃ W ∈ 𝓤 X, W ○ W ⊆ V`. In the metric space case, it corresponds
  to cutting the radius of a ball in half and applying the triangle inequality.
  In the topological group case, it comes from continuity of addition at `(0, 0)`.

These three axioms are stated more abstractly in the definition below, in terms of
operations on filters, without directly manipulating entourages.

## Main definitions

* `UniformSpace X` is a uniform space structure on a type `X`
* `UniformContinuous f` is a predicate saying a function `f : α → β` between uniform spaces
  is uniformly continuous : `∀ r ∈ 𝓤 β, ∀ᶠ (x : α × α) in 𝓤 α, (f x.1, f x.2) ∈ r`

## Notations

Localized in `Uniformity`, we have the notation `𝓤 X` for the uniformity on a uniform space `X`,
and `○` for composition of relations, seen as terms with type `Set (X × X)`.

## Implementation notes

There is already a theory of relations in `Data/Rel.lean` where the main definition is
`def Rel (α β : Type*) := α → β → Prop`.
The relations used in the current file involve only one type, but this is not the reason why
we don't reuse `Data/Rel.lean`. We use `Set (α × α)`
instead of `Rel α α` because we really need sets to use the filter library, and elements
of filters on `α × α` have type `Set (α × α)`.

The structure `UniformSpace X` bundles a uniform structure on `X`, a topology on `X` and
an assumption saying those are compatible. This may not seem mathematically reasonable at first,
but is in fact an instance of the forgetful inheritance pattern. See Note [forgetful inheritance]
below.

## References

The formalization uses the books:

* [N. Bourbaki, *General Topology*][bourbaki1966]
* [I. M. James, *Topologies and Uniformities*][james1999]

But it makes a more systematic use of the filter library.
