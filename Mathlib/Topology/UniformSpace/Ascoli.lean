# Ascoli Theorem

In this file, we prove the general **Arzela-Ascoli theorem**, and various related statements about
the topology of equicontinuous subsets of `X →ᵤ[𝔖] α`, where `X` is a topological space, `𝔖` is
a family of compact subsets of `X`, and `α` is a uniform space.

## Main statements

* If `X` is a compact space, then the uniform structures of uniform convergence and pointwise
  convergence coincide on equicontinuous subsets. This is the key fact that makes equicontinuity
  important in functional analysis. We state various versions of it:
  - as an equality of `UniformSpace`s: `Equicontinuous.comap_uniformFun_eq`
  - in terms of `IsUniformInducing`: `Equicontinuous.isUniformInducing_uniformFun_iff_pi`
  - in terms of `IsInducing`: `Equicontinuous.inducing_uniformFun_iff_pi`
  - in terms of convergence along a filter: `Equicontinuous.tendsto_uniformFun_iff_pi`
* As a consequence, if `𝔖` is a family of compact subsets of `X`, then the uniform structures of
  uniform convergence on `𝔖` and pointwise convergence on `⋃₀ 𝔖` coincide on equicontinuous
  subsets. Again, we prove multiple variations:
  - as an equality of `UniformSpace`s: `EquicontinuousOn.comap_uniformOnFun_eq`
  - in terms of `IsUniformInducing`: `EquicontinuousOn.isUniformInducing_uniformOnFun_iff_pi'`
  - in terms of `IsInducing`: `EquicontinuousOn.inducing_uniformOnFun_iff_pi'`
  - in terms of convergence along a filter: `EquicontinuousOn.tendsto_uniformOnFun_iff_pi'`
* The **Arzela-Ascoli theorem** follows from the previous fact and Tykhonov's theorem.
  All of its variations can be found under the `ArzelaAscoli` namespace.

## Implementation details

* The statements in this file may be a bit daunting because we prove everything for families and
  embeddings instead of subspaces with the subspace topology. This is done because, in practice,
  one would rarely work with `X →ᵤ[𝔖] α` directly, so we need to provide API for bringing back the
  statements to various other types, such as `C(X, Y)` or `E →L[𝕜] F`. To counteract this, all
  statements (as well as most proofs!) are documented quite thoroughly.

* A lot of statements assume `∀ K ∈ 𝔖, EquicontinuousOn F K` instead of the more natural
  `EquicontinuousOn F (⋃₀ 𝔖)`. This is in order to keep the most generality, as the first statement
  is strictly weaker.

* In Bourbaki, the usual Arzela-Ascoli compactness theorem follows from a similar total boundedness
  result. Here we go directly for the compactness result, which is the most useful in practice, but
  this will be an easy addition/refactor if we ever need it.

## TODO

* Prove that, on an equicontinuous family, pointwise convergence and pointwise convergence on a
  dense subset coincide, and deduce metrizability criteria for equicontinuous subsets.

* Prove the total boundedness version of the theorem

* Prove the converse statement: if a subset of `X →ᵤ[𝔖] α` is compact, then it is equicontinuous
  on each `K ∈ 𝔖`.

* `F` is equicontinuous on each `K ∈ 𝔖`
