# Uniform approximation

In this file, we give lemmas ensuring that a function is continuous if it can be approximated
uniformly by continuous functions. We give various versions, within a set or the whole space, at
a single point or at all points, with locally uniform approximation or uniform approximation. All
the statements are derived from a statement about locally uniform approximation within a set at
a point, called `continuousWithinAt_of_locally_uniform_approx_of_continuousWithinAt`.

## Implementation notes

Most results hold under weaker assumptions of locally uniform approximation. In a first section,
we prove the results under these weaker assumptions. Then, we derive the results on uniform
convergence from them.

### Uniform limits

From the previous statements on uniform approximation, we deduce continuity results for uniform
limits.

### Composing limits under uniform convergence

In general, if `Fₙ` converges pointwise to a function `f`, and `gₙ` tends to `x`, it is not true
that `Fₙ gₙ` tends to `f x`. It is true however if the convergence of `Fₙ` to `f` is uniform. In
this paragraph, we prove variations around this statement.

/-- If `Fₙ` converges locally uniformly on a neighborhood of `x` within a set `s` to a function `f`
which is continuous at `x` within `s`, and `gₙ` tends to `x` within `s`, then `Fₙ (gₙ)` tends
to `f x`. -/
