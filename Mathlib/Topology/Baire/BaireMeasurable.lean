# Baire category and Baire measurable sets

This file defines some of the basic notions of Baire category and Baire measurable sets.

## Main definitions

First, we define the notation `=ᵇ`. This denotes eventual equality with respect to the filter of
`residual` sets in a topological space.

A set `s` in a topological space `α` is called a `BaireMeasurableSet` or said to have the
*property of Baire* if it satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions:

* There is a *Borel* set `u` such that `s =ᵇ u`. (This is our definition)
* There is an *open* set `u` such that `s =ᵇ u`. (See `BaireMeasurableSet.residual_eq_open`)

It is equivalent, and a more standard definition, to say that the set differs from
some *open* set by a meager set. See `BaireMeasurableSet.iff_residualEq_isOpen` -/
