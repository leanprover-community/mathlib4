# Neighborhoods and continuity relative to a subset

This file develops API on the relative versions

* `ContinuousOn`        of `Continuous`
* `ContinuousWithinAt`  of `ContinuousAt`

related to continuity, which are defined in previous definition files.
Their basic properties studied in this file include the relationships between
these restricted notions and the corresponding notions for the subtype
equipped with the subspace topology.

## `ContinuousWithinAt`

/-- If a function is continuous within `s` at `x`, then it tends to `f x` within `s` by definition.
We register this fact for use with the dot notation, especially to use `Filter.Tendsto.comp` as
`ContinuousWithinAt.comp` will have a different meaning. -/
