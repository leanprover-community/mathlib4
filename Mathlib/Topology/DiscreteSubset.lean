# Discrete subsets of topological spaces

Given a topological space `X` together with a subset `s ⊆ X`, there are two distinct concepts of
"discreteness" which may hold. These are:
  (i) Every point of `s` is isolated (i.e., the subset topology induced on `s` is the discrete
      topology).
 (ii) Every compact subset of `X` meets `s` only finitely often (i.e., the inclusion map `s → X`
      tends to the cocompact filter along the cofinite filter on `s`).

When `s` is closed, the two conditions are equivalent provided `X` is locally compact and T1,
see `IsClosed.tendsto_coe_cofinite_iff`.
