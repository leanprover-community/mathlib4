# Checking the sheaf condition on the underlying presheaf of types.

If `G : C ⥤ D` is a functor which reflects isomorphisms and preserves limits
(we assume all limits exist in both `C` and `D`),
then checking the sheaf condition for a presheaf `F : presheaf C X`
is equivalent to checking the sheaf condition for `F ⋙ G`.

The important special case is when
`C` is a concrete category with a forgetful functor
that preserves limits and reflects isomorphisms.
Then to check the sheaf condition it suffices
to check it on the underlying sheaf of types.

The important special case is when

Another useful example is the forgetful functor `TopCommRing ⥤ Top`.

In fact we prove a stronger version with arbitrary complete target category.
