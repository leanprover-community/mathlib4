# Presheaves of functions

We construct some simple examples of presheaves of functions on a topological space.
* `presheafToTypes X T`, where `T : X → Type`,
  is the presheaf of dependently-typed (not-necessarily continuous) functions
* `presheafToType X T`, where `T : Type`,
  is the presheaf of (not-necessarily-continuous) functions to a fixed target type `T`
* `presheafToTop X T`, where `T : TopCat`,
  is the presheaf of continuous functions into a topological space `T`
* `presheafToTopCommRing X R`, where `R : TopCommRingCat`
  is the presheaf valued in `CommRing` of functions functions into a topological ring `R`
* as an example of the previous construction,
  `presheafToTopCommRing X (TopCommRingCat.of ℂ)`
  is the presheaf of rings of continuous complex-valued functions on `X`.
