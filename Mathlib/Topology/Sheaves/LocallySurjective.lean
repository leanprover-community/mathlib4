# Locally surjective maps of presheaves.

Let `X` be a topological space, `ℱ` and `𝒢` presheaves on `X`, `T : ℱ ⟶ 𝒢` a map.

In this file we formulate two notions for what it means for
`T` to be locally surjective:

  1. For each open set `U`, each section `t : 𝒢(U)` is in the image of `T`
     after passing to some open cover of `U`.

  2. For each `x : X`, the map of *stalks* `Tₓ : ℱₓ ⟶ 𝒢ₓ` is surjective.

We prove that these are equivalent.

/-- A map of presheaves `T : ℱ ⟶ 𝒢` is **locally surjective** if for any open set `U`,
section `t` over `U`, and `x ∈ U`, there exists an open set `x ∈ V ⊆ U` and a section `s` over `V`
such that `$T_*(s_V) = t|_V$`.
