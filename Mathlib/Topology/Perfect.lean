# Perfect Sets

In this file we define perfect subsets of a topological space, and prove some basic properties,
including a version of the Cantor-Bendixson Theorem.

## Main Definitions

* `Perfect C`: A set `C` is perfect, meaning it is closed and every point of it
  is an accumulation point of itself.
* `PerfectSpace X`: A topological space `X` is perfect if its universe is a perfect set.

## Main Statements

* `Perfect.splitting`: A perfect nonempty set contains two disjoint perfect nonempty subsets.
  The main inductive step in the construction of an embedding from the Cantor space to a
  perfect nonempty complete metric space.
* `exists_countable_union_perfect_of_isClosed`: One version of the **Cantor-Bendixson Theorem**:
  A closed set in a second countable space can be written as the union of a countable set and a
  perfect set.

## Implementation Notes

We do not require perfect sets to be nonempty.

We define a nonstandard predicate, `Preperfect`, which drops the closed-ness requirement
from the definition of perfect. In T1 spaces, this is equivalent to having a perfect closure,
see `preperfect_iff_perfect_closure`.

## See also

`Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Perfect`, for properties of perfect sets in metric spaces,
namely Polish spaces.
