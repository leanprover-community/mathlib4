# CW-complexes

This file defines (relative) CW-complexes using a categorical approach.

## Main definitions

* `RelativeCWComplex`: A relative CW-complex is the colimit of an expanding sequence of subspaces
  `sk i` (called the $(i-1)$-skeleton) for `i ‚â• 0`, where `sk 0` (i.e., the $(-1)$-skeleton) is an
  arbitrary topological space, and each `sk (n + 1)` (i.e., the $n$-skeleton) is obtained from
  `sk n` (i.e., the $(n-1)$-skeleton) by attaching `n`-disks.

* `CWComplex`: A CW-complex is a relative CW-complex whose `sk 0` (i.e., $(-1)$-skeleton) is empty.

## Implementation Notes

This file provides a categorical approach to CW complexes,
defining them via colimits and transfinite compositions.
For a classical approach that defines CW complexes via explicit cells and attaching maps,
see `Mathlib/Topology/CWComplex/Classical/Basic.lean`.
The two approaches are equivalent but serve different purposes:
* This approach is more suitable for categorical arguments and generalizations
* The classical approach is more convenient for concrete geometric arguments

## References

* [R. Fritsch and R. Piccinini, *Cellular Structures in Topology*][fritsch-piccinini1990]

## TODO

* Prove the equivalence between this categorical approach and the classical approach in
  `Mathlib/Topology/CWComplex/Classical/Basic.lean`.
  Currently there is no way to move between the two definitions.
