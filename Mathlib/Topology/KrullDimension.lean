# The Krull dimension of a topological space

The Krull dimension of a topological space is the order theoretic Krull dimension applied to the
collection of all its subsets that are closed and irreducible. Unfolding this definition, it is
the length of longest series of closed irreducible subsets ordered by inclusion.

TODO: The Krull dimension of `Spec(R)` equals the Krull dimension of `R`, for `R` a commutative
  ring.

The Krull dimension of a topological space is the supremum of lengths of chains of
