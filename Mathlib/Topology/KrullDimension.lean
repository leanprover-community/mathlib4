# The Krull dimension of a topological space

The Krull dimension of a topological space is the order theoretic Krull dimension applied to the
collection of all its subsets that are closed and irreducible. Unfolding this definition, it is
the length of longest series of closed irreducible subsets ordered by inclusion.

/--
The Krull dimension of a topological space is the supremum of lengths of chains of
closed irreducible sets.

/--
Map induced on irreducible closed subsets by a closed continuous map `f`.
This is just a wrapper around the image of `f` together with proofs that it
preserves irreducibility (by continuity) and closedness (since `f` is closed).

/--
Taking images under a closed embedding is strictly monotone on the preorder of irreducible closeds.

/--
If `f : X → Y` is a closed embedding, then the Krull dimension of `X` is less than or equal
to the Krull dimension of `Y`.
