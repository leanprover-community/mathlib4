# Kőnig's infinity lemma

Kőnig's infinity lemma is most often stated as a graph theory result :
every infinite, locally finite connected graph contains an infinite path.
It has links to computability and proof theory, and is in fact a specialization
of `nonempty_sections_of_finite_cofiltered_system`.
It is stated and proved here with fewer dependencies.

In practice, most applications are not to an abstract graph,
but to a concrete collection of objects that are organized in a graph-like way,
often where the graph is a rooted tree representing a graded order.
In fact, the lemma is in fact most easily stated and proved
in terms of covers in a strongly atomic order rather than a graph;
in this setting, the proof is almost trivial.

We leave the explicitly graph-theoretic version of the statement as TODO.

## Main Results

* `exists_seq_covby_of_forall_covby_finite` : Kőnig's lemma for strongly atomic orders.

* `exists_orderEmbedding_covby_of_forall_covby_finite` : Kőnig's lemma, where the sequence
  is given as an `OrderEmbedding` instead of a function.

* `exists_orderEmbedding_covby_of_forall_covby_finite_of_bot` : Kőnig's lemma where the sequence
  starts at the minimum of an infinite type.

* `exist_seq_forall_proj_of_forall_finite` : Kőnig's lemma applied to an order on a sigma-type
  `(i : ℕ) × α i`.

## TODO

Formulate the lemma as a statement about graphs.

/-- A formulation of Kőnig's infinity lemma, useful in applications.
Given a sequence `α 0, α 1, ...` of nonempty types with `α 0` a subsingleton,
and a well-behaved family of projections `π : α j → α i` for all `i ≤ j`,
if each term in each `α i` is the projection of only finitely many terms in `α (i+1)`,
then we can find a sequence `(f 0 : α 0), (f 1 : α 1), ...`
where `f i` is the projection of `f j` for all `i ≤ j`.

In a typical application, the `α i` are function types with increasingly large domains,
and `π hij (f : α j)` is the restriction of the domain of `f` to that of `α i`.
In this case, the sequence given by the lemma is essentially a function whose domain
is the limit of the `α i`.

See also `nonempty_sections_of_finite_cofiltered_system`. -/
