# Heyting algebras

This file defines Heyting, co-Heyting and bi-Heyting algebras.

A Heyting algebra is a bounded distributive lattice with an implication operation `⇨` such that
`a ≤ b ⇨ c ↔ a ⊓ b ≤ c`. It also comes with a pseudo-complement `ᶜ`, such that `aᶜ = a ⇨ ⊥`.

Co-Heyting algebras are dual to Heyting algebras. They have a difference `\` and a negation `￢`
such that `a \ b ≤ c ↔ a ≤ b ⊔ c` and `￢a = ⊤ \ a`.

Bi-Heyting algebras are Heyting algebras that are also co-Heyting algebras.

From a logic standpoint, Heyting algebras precisely model intuitionistic logic, whereas Boolean
algebras model classical logic.

Heyting algebras are the order-theoretic equivalent of Cartesian closed categories.

/-! In this section, we'll give interpretations of these results in the Heyting algebra model of
intuitionistic logic,- where `≤` can be interpreted as "validates", `⇨` as "implies", `⊓` as "and",
`⊔` as "or", `⊥` as "false" and `⊤` as "true". Note that we confuse `→` and `⊢` because those are
the same in this logic.
