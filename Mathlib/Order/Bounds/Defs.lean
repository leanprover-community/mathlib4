# Definitions about upper/lower bounds

In this file we define:
* `upperBounds`, `lowerBounds` : the set of upper bounds (resp., lower bounds) of a set;
* `BddAbove s`, `BddBelow s` : the set `s` is bounded above (resp., below), i.e., the set of upper
  (resp., lower) bounds of `s` is nonempty;
* `IsLeast s a`, `IsGreatest s a` : `a` is a least (resp., greatest) element of `s`;
  for a partial order, it is unique if exists;
* `IsLUB s a`, `IsGLB s a` : `a` is a least upper bound (resp., a greatest lower bound)
  of `s`; for a partial order, it is unique if exists.
* `IsCofinal s`: for every `a`, there exists a member of `s` greater or equal to it.
