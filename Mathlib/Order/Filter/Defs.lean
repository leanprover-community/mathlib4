# Definitions about filters

A *filter* on a type `α` is a collection of sets of `α` which contains the whole `α`,
is upwards-closed, and is stable under intersection. Filters are mostly used to
abstract two related kinds of ideas:
* *limits*, including finite or infinite limits of sequences, finite or infinite limits of functions
  at a point or at infinity, etc...
* *things happening eventually*, including things happening for large enough `n : ℕ`, or near enough
  a point `x`, or for close enough pairs of points, or things happening almost everywhere in the
  sense of measure theory. Dually, filters can also express the idea of *things happening often*:
  for arbitrarily large `n`, or at a point in any neighborhood of given a point etc...

## Main definitions

* `Filter` : filters on a set;
* `Filter.principal`, `𝓟 s` : filter of all sets containing a given set;
* `Filter.map`, `Filter.comap` : operations on filters;
* `Filter.Tendsto` : limit with respect to filters;
* `Filter.Eventually` : `f.Eventually p` means `{x | p x} ∈ f`;
* `Filter.Frequently` : `f.Frequently p` means `{x | ¬p x} ∉ f`;
* `filter_upwards [h₁, ..., hₙ]` :
  a tactic that takes a list of proofs `hᵢ : sᵢ ∈ f`,
  and replaces a goal `s ∈ f` with `∀ x, x ∈ s₁ → ... → x ∈ sₙ → x ∈ s`;
* `Filter.NeBot f` : a utility class stating that `f` is a non-trivial filter.
* `Filter.IsBounded r f`: the filter `f` is eventually bounded w.r.t. the relation `r`,
  i.e. eventually, it is bounded by some uniform bound.
  `r` will be usually instantiated with `(· ≤ ·)` or `(· ≥ ·)`.
* `Filter.IsCobounded r f` states that the filter `f` does not tend to infinity w.r.t. `r`.
  This is also called frequently bounded. Will be usually instantiated with `(· ≤ ·)` or `(· ≥ ·)`.

## Notation

* `∀ᶠ x in f, p x` : `f.Eventually p`;
* `∃ᶠ x in f, p x` : `f.Frequently p`;
* `f =ᶠ[l] g` : `∀ᶠ x in l, f x = g x`;
* `f ≤ᶠ[l] g` : `∀ᶠ x in l, f x ≤ g x`;
* `𝓟 s` : `Filter.Principal s`, localized in `Filter`.

## Implementation Notes

Important note: Bourbaki requires that a filter on `X` cannot contain all sets of `X`,
which we do *not* require.
This gives `Filter X` better formal properties,
in particular a bottom element `⊥` for its lattice structure,
at the cost of including the assumption `[NeBot f]` in a number of lemmas and definitions.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ]` replaces a goal of the form `s ∈ f` and terms
`h₁ : t₁ ∈ f, ⋯, hₙ : tₙ ∈ f` with `∀ x, x ∈ t₁ → ⋯ → x ∈ tₙ → x ∈ s`.
The list is an optional parameter, `[]` being its default value.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] using e` is a short form for

Combining both shortcuts is done by writing `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ using e`.
