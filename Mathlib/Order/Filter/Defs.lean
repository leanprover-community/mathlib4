# Definitions about filters

A *filter* on a type `α` is a collection of sets of `α` which contains the whole `α`,
is upwards-closed, and is stable under intersection. Filters are mostly used to
abstract two related kinds of ideas:
* *limits*, including finite or infinite limits of sequences, finite or infinite limits of functions
  at a point or at infinity, etc...
* *things happening eventually*, including things happening for large enough `n : ℕ`, or near enough
  a point `x`, or for close enough pairs of points, or things happening almost everywhere in the
  sense of measure theory. Dually, filters can also express the idea of *things happening often*:
  for arbitrarily large `n`, or at a point in any neighborhood of given a point etc...

## Main definitions

* `Filter` : filters on a set;
* `Filter.principal`, `𝓟 s` : filter of all sets containing a given set;
* `Filter.map`, `Filter.comap` : operations on filters;
* `Filter.Tendsto` : limit with respect to filters;
* `Filter.Eventually` : `f.Eventually p` means `{x | p x} ∈ f`;
* `Filter.Frequently` : `f.Frequently p` means `{x | ¬p x} ∉ f`;
* `filter_upwards [h₁, ..., hₙ]` :
  a tactic that takes a list of proofs `hᵢ : sᵢ ∈ f`,
  and replaces a goal `s ∈ f` with `∀ x, x ∈ s₁ → ... → x ∈ sₙ → x ∈ s`;
* `Filter.NeBot f` : a utility class stating that `f` is a non-trivial filter.
* `Filter.IsBounded r f`: the filter `f` is eventually bounded w.r.t. the relation `r`,
  i.e. eventually, it is bounded by some uniform bound.
  `r` will be usually instantiated with `(· ≤ ·)` or `(· ≥ ·)`.
* `Filter.IsCobounded r f` states that the filter `f` does not tend to infinity w.r.t. `r`.
  This is also called frequently bounded. Will be usually instantiated with `(· ≤ ·)` or `(· ≥ ·)`.

## Notations

* `∀ᶠ x in f, p x` : `f.Eventually p`;
* `∃ᶠ x in f, p x` : `f.Frequently p`;
* `f =ᶠ[l] g` : `∀ᶠ x in l, f x = g x`;
* `f ≤ᶠ[l] g` : `∀ᶠ x in l, f x ≤ g x`;
* `𝓟 s` : `Filter.Principal s`, localized in `Filter`.

## Implementation Notes

Important note: Bourbaki requires that a filter on `X` cannot contain all sets of `X`,
which we do *not* require.
This gives `Filter X` better formal properties,
in particular a bottom element `⊥` for its lattice structure,
at the cost of including the assumption `[NeBot f]` in a number of lemmas and definitions.

complete lattices. This will be relevant to deduce theorems on complete lattices from their
versions on conditionally complete lattices with additional assumptions. We have to be careful in
the edge case of the trivial filter containing the empty set: the other natural definition

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ]` replaces a goal of the form `s ∈ f` and terms
`h₁ : t₁ ∈ f, ⋯, hₙ : tₙ ∈ f` with `∀ x, x ∈ t₁ → ⋯ → x ∈ tₙ → x ∈ s`.
The list is an optional parameter, `[]` being its default value.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ` is a short form for
`{ filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ], intro a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ }`.

`filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] using e` is a short form for
`{ filter_upwards [h1, ⋯, hn], exact e }`.

Combining both shortcuts is done by writing `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ using e`.
Note that in this case, the `aᵢ` terms can be used in `e`.
