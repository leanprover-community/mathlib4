# Curried Filters

This file provides an operation (`Filter.curry`) on filters which provides the equivalence
`∀ᶠ a in l, ∀ᶠ b in l', p (a, b) ↔ ∀ᶠ c in (l.curry l'), p c` (see `Filter.eventually_curry_iff`).

To understand when this operation might arise, it is helpful to think of `∀ᶠ` as a combination of
the quantifiers `∃ ∀`. For instance, `∀ᶠ n in atTop, p n ↔ ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, p n`. A curried filter
yields the quantifier order `∃ ∀ ∃ ∀`. For instance,
`∀ᶠ n in atTop.curry atTop, p n ↔ ∃ M, ∀ m ≥ M, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, p (m, n)`.

This is different from a product filter, which instead yields a quantifier order `∃ ∃ ∀ ∀`. For
instance, `∀ᶠ n in atTop ×ˢ atTop, p n ↔ ∃ M, ∃ N, ∀ m ≥ M, ∀ n ≥ N, p (m, n)`. This makes it
clear that if something eventually occurs on the product filter, it eventually occurs on the curried
filter (see `Filter.curry_le_prod` and `Filter.Eventually.curry`), but the converse is not true.

Another way to think about the curried versus the product filter is that tending to some limit on
the product filter is a version of uniform convergence (see `tendsto_prod_filter_iff`) whereas
tending to some limit on a curried filter is just iterated limits (see `Filter.Tendsto.curry`).

In the "generalized set" intuition, `Filter.prod` and `Filter.curry` correspond to two ways of
describing the product of two sets, namely `s ×ˢ t = fst ⁻¹' s ∩ snd ⁻¹' t` and
`s ×ˢ t = ⋃ x ∈ s, (x, ·) '' t`.

## Main definitions

* `Filter.curry`: A binary operation on filters which represents iterated limits

## Main statements

* `Filter.eventually_curry_iff`: An alternative definition of a curried filter
* `Filter.curry_le_prod`: Something that is eventually true on the a product filter is eventually
   true on the curried filter
