# Convergence to infinity and countably generated filters

In this file we prove that

- `Filter.atTop` and `Filter.atBot` filters on a countable type are countably generated;
- `Filter.exists_seq_tendsto`: if `f` is a nontrivial countably generated filter,
  then there exists a sequence that converges. to `f`;
- `Filter.tendsto_iff_seq_tendsto`: convergence along a countably generated filter
  is equivalent to convergence along all sequences that converge to this filter.
