# Separating prime filters and ideals

In a bounded distributive lattice, if $F$ is a filter, $I$ is an ideal, and $F$ and $I$ are
disjoint, then there exists a prime ideal $J$ containing $I$ with $J$ still disjoint from $F$.
This theorem is a crucial ingredient to [Stone's][Sto1938] duality for bounded distributive
lattices. The construction of the separator relies on Zorn's lemma.
