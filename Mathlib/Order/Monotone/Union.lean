# Monotonicity on intervals

In this file we prove that a function is (strictly) monotone (or antitone) on a linear order `α`
provided that it is (strictly) monotone on `(-∞, a]` and on `[a, +∞)`. This is a special case
of a more general statement where one deduces monotonicity on a union from monotonicity on each
set.
