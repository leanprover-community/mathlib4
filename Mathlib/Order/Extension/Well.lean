# Extend a well-founded order to a well-order

This file constructs a well-order (linear well-founded order) which is an extension of a given
well-founded order.

## Proof idea

We can map our order into two well-orders:
* the first map respects the order but isn't necessarily injective. Namely, this is the *rank*
  function `IsWellFounded.rank : α → Ordinal`.
* the second map is injective but doesn't necessarily respect the order. This is an arbitrary
  embedding into `Cardinal` given by `embeddingToCardinal`.

Then their lexicographic product is a well-founded linear order which our original order injects in.

## Implementation note

The definition in `mathlib` 3 used an auxiliary well-founded order on `α` lifted from `Cardinal`,
instead of using `Cardinal` directly. The new definition is definitionally equal
to the `mathlib` 3 version but avoids non-standard instances.

namespace IsWellFounded

variable {α : Type u} (r : α → α → Prop) [IsWellFounded α r]

/-- An arbitrary well order on `α` that extends `r`.

The construction maps `r` into two well-orders: the first map is `IsWellFounded.rank`, which is not
necessarily injective but respects the order `r`; the other map is the identity (with an arbitrarily
chosen well-order on `α`), which is injective but doesn't respect `r`.

By taking the lexicographic product of the two, we get both properties, so we can pull it back and
get a well-order that extend our original order `r`. Another way to view this is that we choose an
arbitrary well-order to serve as a tiebreak between two elements of same rank.
