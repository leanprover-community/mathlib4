# Game addition relation

This file defines, given relations `rα : α → α → Prop` and `rβ : β → β → Prop`, a relation
`Prod.GameAdd` on pairs, such that `GameAdd rα rβ x y` iff `x` can be reached from `y` by
decreasing either entry (with respect to `rα` and `rβ`). It is so called since it models the
subsequency relation on the addition of combinatorial games.

## Main definitions and results

- `Prod.GameAdd`: the game addition relation on ordered pairs.
- `WellFounded.prod_gameAdd`: formalizes induction on ordered pairs, where exactly one entry
  decreases at a time.

## Todo

- Add custom `induction` and `fix` lemmas.
- Define `Sym2.GameAdd`.

/-- The "addition of games" relation in combinatorial game theory, on the product type: if
  `rα a' a` means that `a ⟶ a'` is a valid move in game `α`, and `rβ b' b` means that `b ⟶ b'`
  is a valid move in game `β`, then `GameAdd rα rβ` specifies the valid moves in the juxtaposition
  of `α` and `β`: the player is free to choose one of the games and make a move in it,
  while leaving the other game unchanged. -/
