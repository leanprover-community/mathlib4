# The radical of a lattice

This file contains results on the order radical of a lattice: the infimum of the coatoms.
-/

/--
The infimum of all coatoms.

This notion specializes, e.g. in the subgroup lattice of a group to the Frattini subgroup,
or in the lattices of ideals in a ring `R` to the Jacobson ideal.
