/-!
Defines a command wrapper that prints the number of heartbeats used in the enclosed command.

For example
```
count_heartbeats in
theorem foo : 42 = 6 * 7 := rfl
```
will produce an info message containing a number around 51.
If this number is above the current `maxHeartbeats`, we also print a `Try this:` suggestion.

open Lean Elab Command Meta

namespace Mathlib.CountHeartbeats


/--
Count the heartbeats used in the enclosed command.

This is most useful for setting sufficient but reasonable limits via `set_option maxHeartbeats`
for long running declarations.

If you do so, please resist the temptation to set the limit as low as possible.
As the `simp` set and other features of the library evolve,
other contributors will find that their (likely unrelated) changes
have pushed the declaration over the limit.
`count_heartbearts in` will automatically suggest a `set_option maxHeartbeats` via "Try this:"
using the least number of the form `2^k * 200000` that suffices.

Note that that internal heartbeat counter accessible via `IO.getNumHeartbeats`
has granularity 1000 times finer that the limits set by `set_option maxHeartbeats`.
As this is intended as a user command, we divide by 1000.
