Defines a command wrapper that prints the number of heartbeats used in the enclosed command.

For example
```
#count_heartbeats in
theorem foo : 42 = 6 * 7 := rfl
```
will produce an info message containing a number around 51.
If this number is above the current `maxHeartbeats`, we also print a `Try this:` suggestion.

`#count_heartbeats in cmd` counts the heartbeats used in the enclosed command `cmd`.
Use `#count_heartbeats` to count the heartbeats in *all* the following declarations.

This is most useful for setting sufficient but reasonable limits via `set_option maxHeartbeats`
for long running declarations.

If you do so, please resist the temptation to set the limit as low as possible.
As the `simp` set and other features of the library evolve,
other contributors will find that their (likely unrelated) changes
have pushed the declaration over the limit.
`count_heartbearts in` will automatically suggest a `set_option maxHeartbeats` via "Try this:"
using the least number of the form `2^k * 200000` that suffices.

Note that that internal heartbeat counter accessible via `IO.getNumHeartbeats`
has granularity 1000 times finer that the limits set by `set_option maxHeartbeats`.
As this is intended as a user command, we divide by 1000.

The optional `approximately` keyword rounds down the heartbeats to the nearest thousand.
This helps make the tests more stable to small changes in heartbeats.
To use this functionality, use `#count_heartbeats approximately in cmd`.

Guard the minimal number of heartbeats used in the enclosed command.

This is most useful in the context of debugging and minimizing an example of a slow declaration.
By guarding the number of heartbeats used in the slow declaration,
an error message will be generated if a minimization step makes the slow behaviour go away.

The default number of minimal heartbeats is the value of `maxHeartbeats` (typically 200000).
Alternatively, you can specify a number of heartbeats to guard against,
using the syntax `guard_min_heartbeats n in cmd`.

The optional `approximately` keyword rounds down the heartbeats to the nearest thousand.
This helps make the tests more stable to small changes in heartbeats.
To use this functionality, use `guard_min_heartbeats approximately (n)? in cmd`.

The "countHeartbeats" linter counts the heartbeats of every declaration.

The effect of the linter is similar to `#count_heartbeats in xxx`, except that it applies
to all declarations.

Note that the linter only counts heartbeats in "top-level" declarations:
it looks inside `set_option ... in`, but not, for instance, inside `mutual` blocks.

There is a convenience notation `#count_heartbeats` that simply sets the linter option to true.
