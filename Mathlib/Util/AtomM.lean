# A monad for tracking and deduplicating atoms

This monad is used by tactics like `ring` and `abel` to keep uninterpreted atoms in a consistent
order, and also to allow unifying atoms up to a specified transparency mode.

Note: this can become very expensive because it is using `isDefEq`.
For performance reasons, consider whether `Lean.Meta.Canonicalizer.canon` can be used instead.
After canonicalizing, a `HashMap Expr Nat` suffices to keep track of previously seen atoms,
and is much faster as it uses `Expr` equality rather than `isDefEq`.
