import Mathlib.Util.PPBetaOption

/-! Add the `pp.beta` feature to the pretty printer

By importing this module, you can do
```lean
set_option pp.beta true
```
and then the pretty printer will beta reduce all expressions.
The option can see through mdata for beta reduction opportunities,
but it will otherwise preserve mdata.

This option is not recommended and can lead to very confusing situations.
For example:
```lean
example {α β : Type} (f : α → β) (a : α) (b : β) (h : f a = b) :
    (fun x ↦ f x) a = b := by
  /-
  α β : Type
  f : α → β
  a : α
  b : β
  h : f a = b
  ⊢ f a = b
  -/
  rw [h] -- fails
```

Additional caveats:
1. `pp.beta` is incompatible with pretty printer features that
   store data by expression position, for example `pp.analyze`.
2. Tooltips in the info view might display beta unreduced terms.
   This defect is expected to be limited to just the outermost expression.

This is incompatible with the `pp.analyze` option.
In general it can clear `optionsPerPos`.
