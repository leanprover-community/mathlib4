/-- A helper function for constructing a related declaration from an existing one.

This is currently used by the attributes `reassoc` and `elementwise`,
and has been factored out to avoid code duplication.
Feel free to add features as needed for other applications.

This helper:
* calls `addDeclarationRanges`, so jump-to-definition works,
* copies the `protected` status of the existing declaration, and
* supports copying attributes.

Arguments:
* `src : Name` is the existing declaration that we are modifying.
* `suffix : String` will be appended to `src` to form the name of the new declaration.
* `ref : Syntax` is the syntax where the user requested the related declaration.
* `construct type value levels : MetaM (Expr × List Name)`
  given the type, value, and universe variables of the original declaration,
  should construct the value of the new declaration,
  along with the names of its universe variables.
* `attrs` is the attributes that should be applied to both the new and the original declaration,
  e.g. in the usage `@[reassoc (attr := simp)]`.
  We apply it to both declarations, to have the same behavior as `to_additive`, and to shorten some
  attribute commands. Note that `@[elementwise (attr := simp), reassoc (attr := simp)]` will try
  to apply `simp` twice to the current declaration, but that causes no issues.
