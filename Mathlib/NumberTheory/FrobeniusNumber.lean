# Frobenius Number in Two Variables

In this file we first define a predicate for Frobenius numbers, then solve the 2-variable variant
of this problem.

## Theorem Statement

Given a finite set of relatively prime integers all greater than 1, their Frobenius number is the
largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of nonnegative multiples of these
integers. Here we show the Frobenius number of two relatively prime integers `m` and `n` greater
than 1 is `m * n - m - n`. This result is also known as the Chicken McNugget Theorem.

## Implementation Notes

First we define Frobenius numbers in general using `IsGreatest` and `AddSubmonoid.closure`. Then
we proceed to compute the Frobenius number of `m` and `n`.

For the upper bound, we begin with an auxiliary lemma showing `m * n` is not attainable, then show
`m * n - m - n` is not attainable. Then for the construction, we create a `k_1` which is `k mod n`
and `0 mod m`, then show it is at most `k`. Then `k_1` is a multiple of `m`, so `(k-k_1)`
is a multiple of n, and we're done.

/-- A natural number `n` is the **Frobenius number** of a set of natural numbers `s` if it is an
upper bound on the complement of the additive submonoid generated by `s`.
In other words, it is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of numbers in `s`. -/
