# Mason-Stothers theorem

This file states and proves the Mason-Stothers theorem, which is a polynomial version of the
ABC conjecture. For (pairwise) coprime polynomials `a, b, c` (over a field) with `a + b + c = 0`,
we have `max {deg(a), deg(b), deg(c)} + 1 ≤ deg(rad(abc))` or `a' = b' = c' = 0`.

Proof is based on this online note by Franz Lemmermeyer http://www.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/~franz/ag05/ag-02.pdf,
which is essentially based on Noah Snyder's paper "An Alternative Proof of Mason's Theorem",
but slightly different.

## TODO

Prove polynomial FLT using Mason-Stothers theorem.
