! This file was ported from Lean 3 source module data.buffer.parser
! leanprover-community/lean commit 549e2fed50b361d0d49a3dd1e7ccb6de9440059b
! Please do not edit these lines, except to modify the commit id
! if you have ported upstream changes.

Porting note:
As the parsing framework has completely changed in Lean 4
there is no point porting these files directly.
They can be rewritten from scratch as needed, just as for tactics.
