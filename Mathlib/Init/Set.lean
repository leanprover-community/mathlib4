# Sets

This file sets up the theory of sets whose elements have a given type.

## Main definitions

Given a type `X` and a predicate `p : X → Prop`:

* `Set X` : the type of sets whose elements have type `X`
* `{a : X | p a} : Set X` : the set of all elements of `X` satisfying `p`
* `{a | p a} : Set X` : a more concise notation for `{a : X | p a}`
* `{f x y | (x : X) (y : Y)} : Set Z` : a more concise notation for `{z : Z | ∃ x y, f x y = z}`
* `{a ∈ S | p a} : Set X` : given `S : Set X`, the subset of `S` consisting of
   its elements satisfying `p`.

## Implementation issues

As in Lean 3, `Set X := X → Prop`

I didn't call this file Data.Set.Basic because it contains core Lean 3
stuff which happens before mathlib3's data.set.basic .
This file is a port of the core Lean 3 file `lib/lean/library/init/data/set.lean`.

/-- A set is a collection of elements of some type `α`.

Although `Set` is defined as `α → Prop`, this is an implementation detail which should not be
relied on. Instead, `setOf` and membership of a set (`∈`) should be used to convert between sets
and predicates.

`{ f x y | (x : X) (y : Y) }` is notation for the set of elements `f x y` constructed from the
binders `x` and `y`, equivalent to `{z : Z | ∃ x y, f x y = z}`.

If `f x y` is a single identifier, it must be parenthesized to avoid ambiguity with `{x | p x}`;
for instance, `{(x) | (x : Nat) (y : Nat) (_hxy : x = y^2)}`.

* `{ pat : X | p }` is notation for pattern matching in set-builder notation,
  where `pat` is a pattern that is matched by all objects of type `X`
  and `p` is a proposition that can refer to variables in the pattern.
  It is the set of all objects of type `X` which, when matched with the pattern `pat`,
  make `p` come out true.
* `{ pat | p }` is the same, but in the case when the type `X` can be inferred.

For example, `{ (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m * n = 12 }` denotes the set of all ordered pairs of
natural numbers whose product is 12.

Note that if the type ascription is left out and `p` can be interpreted as an extended binder,
then the extended binder interpretation will be used.  For example, `{ n + 1 | n < 3 }` will
be interpreted as `{ x : Nat | ∃ n < 3, n + 1 = x }` rather than using pattern matching.

/-- The universal set on a type `α` is the set containing all elements of `α`.

This is conceptually the "same as" `α` (in set theory, it is actually the same), but type theory
makes the distinction that `α` is a type while `Set.univ` is a term of type `Set α`. `Set.univ` can
itself be coerced to a type `↥Set.univ` which is in bijection with (but distinct from) `α`. -/
