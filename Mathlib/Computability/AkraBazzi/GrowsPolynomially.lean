# Akra-Bazzi theorem: The polynomial growth condition

This file defines and develops an API for the polynomial growth condition that appears in the
statement of the Akra-Bazzi theorem: for the Akra-Bazzi theorem to hold, the function `g` must
satisfy the condition that `c₁ g(n) ≤ g(u) ≤ c₂ g(n)`, for u between b*n and n for any constant
`b ∈ (0,1)`.

## Implementation notes

Our definition states that the condition must hold for any `b ∈ (0,1)`. This is equivalent to
only requiring it for `b = 1/2` or any other particular value between 0 and 1. While this
could in principle make it harder to prove that a particular function grows polynomially,
this issue doesn't seem to arise in practice.

/-- The growth condition that the function `g` must satisfy for the Akra-Bazzi theorem to apply.
It roughly states that `c₁ g(n) ≤ g(u) ≤ c₂ g(n)`, for `u` between `b*n` and `n` for any
constant `b ∈ (0,1)`. -/
