# Borel sigma algebras on (pseudo-)metric spaces

## Main statements

* `measurable_dist`, `measurable_infEdist`, `measurable_norm`,
  `Measurable.dist`, `Measurable.infEdist`, `Measurable.norm`:
  measurability of various metric-related notions;
* `tendsto_measure_thickening_of_isClosed`:
  the measure of a closed set is the limit of the measure of its ε-thickenings as ε → 0.
* `exists_borelSpace_of_countablyGenerated_of_separatesPoints`:
  if a measurable space is countably generated and separates points, it arises as the Borel sets
  of some second countable separable metrizable topology.
