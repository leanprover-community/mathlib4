# The Borel sigma-algebra on Polish spaces

We discuss several results pertaining to the relationship between the topology and the Borel
structure on Polish spaces.

## Main definitions and results

First, we define standard Borel spaces.

* A `StandardBorelSpace α` is a typeclass for measurable spaces which arise as the Borel sets
  of some Polish topology.

Next, we define the class of analytic sets and establish its basic properties.

* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet s`: a set in a topological space is analytic if it is the continuous
  image of a Polish space. Equivalently, it is empty, or the image of `ℕ → ℕ`.
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.image_of_continuous`: a continuous image of an analytic set is
  analytic.
* `MeasurableSet.analyticSet`: in a Polish space, any Borel-measurable set is analytic.

Then, we show Lusin's theorem that two disjoint analytic sets can be separated by Borel sets.

* `MeasurablySeparable s t` states that there exists a measurable set containing `s` and disjoint
  from `t`.
* `AnalyticSet.measurablySeparable` shows that two disjoint analytic sets are separated by a
  Borel set.

We then prove the Lusin-Souslin theorem that a continuous injective image of a Borel subset of
a Polish space is Borel. The proof of this nontrivial result relies on the above results on
analytic sets.

* `MeasurableSet.image_of_continuousOn_injOn` asserts that, if `s` is a Borel measurable set in
  a Polish space, then the image of `s` under a continuous injective map is still Borel measurable.
* `Continuous.measurableEmbedding` states that a continuous injective map on a Polish space
  is a measurable embedding for the Borel sigma-algebra.
* `ContinuousOn.measurableEmbedding` is the same result for a map restricted to a measurable set
  on which it is continuous.
* `Measurable.measurableEmbedding` states that a measurable injective map from
  a standard Borel space to a second-countable topological space is a measurable embedding.
* `isClopenable_iff_measurableSet`: in a Polish space, a set is clopenable (i.e., it can be made
  open and closed by using a finer Polish topology) if and only if it is Borel-measurable.

We use this to prove several versions of the Borel isomorphism theorem.

* `PolishSpace.measurableEquivOfNotCountable` : Any two uncountable standard Borel spaces
  are Borel isomorphic.
* `PolishSpace.Equiv.measurableEquiv` : Any two standard Borel spaces of the same cardinality
  are Borel isomorphic.

/-! ### Standard Borel Spaces -/

variable (α : Type*)

/-- A standard Borel space is a measurable space arising as the Borel sets of some Polish topology.
This is useful in situations where a space has no natural topology or
the natural topology in a space is non-Polish.

To endow a standard Borel space `α` with a compatible Polish topology, use
`letI := upgradeStandardBorel α`. One can then use `eq_borel_upgradeStandardBorel α` to
rewrite the `MeasurableSpace α` instance to `borel α t`, where `t` is the new topology. -/
class StandardBorelSpace [MeasurableSpace α] : Prop where
  /-- There exists a compatible Polish topology. -/
  polish : ∃ _ : TopologicalSpace α, BorelSpace α ∧ PolishSpace α

/-- A convenience class similar to `UpgradedPolishSpace`. No instance should be registered.
Instead one should use `letI := upgradeStandardBorel α`. -/
class UpgradedStandardBorel extends MeasurableSpace α, TopologicalSpace α,
  BorelSpace α, PolishSpace α

/-- Use as `letI := upgradeStandardBorel α` to endow a standard Borel space `α` with
a compatible Polish topology.

Warning: following this with `borelize α` will cause an error. Instead, one can
rewrite with `eq_borel_upgradeStandardBorel α`.
TODO: fix the corresponding bug in `borelize`. -/

/-! ### Analytic sets -/

/-- An analytic set is a set which is the continuous image of some Polish space. There are several
equivalent characterizations of this definition. For the definition, we pick one that avoids
universe issues: a set is analytic if and only if it is a continuous image of `ℕ → ℕ` (or if it
is empty). The above more usual characterization is given
in `analyticSet_iff_exists_polishSpace_range`.

Warning: these are analytic sets in the context of descriptive set theory (which is why they are
registered in the namespace `MeasureTheory`). They have nothing to do with analytic sets in the
context of complex analysis. -/

  /- We follow [Fremlin, *Measure Theory* (volume 4, 423I)][fremlin_vol4].
    Let `b = {s i}` be a countable basis for `α`. When `s i` and `s j` are disjoint, their images
    are disjoint analytic sets, hence by the separation theorem one can find a Borel-measurable set
    `q i j` separating them.
    Let `E i = closure (f '' s i) ∩ ⋂ j, q i j \ q j i`. It contains `f '' (s i)` and it is
    measurable. Let `F n = ⋃ E i`, where the union is taken over those `i` for which `diam (s i)`
    is bounded by some number `u n` tending to `0` with `n`.
    We claim that `range f = ⋂ F n`, from which the measurability is obvious. The inclusion `⊆` is
    straightforward. To show `⊇`, consider a point `x` in the intersection. For each `n`, it belongs
    to some `E i` with `diam (s i) ≤ u n`. Pick a point `y i ∈ s i`. We claim that for such `i`
    and `j`, the intersection `s i ∩ s j` is nonempty: if it were empty, then thanks to the
    separating set `q i j` in the definition of `E i` one could not have `x ∈ E i ∩ E j`.
    Since these two sets have small diameter, it follows that `y i` and `y j` are close.
    Thus, `y` is a Cauchy sequence, converging to a limit `z`. We claim that `f z = x`, completing
    the proof.
    Otherwise, one could find open sets `v` and `w` separating `f z` from `x`. Then, for large `n`,
    the image `f '' (s i)` would be included in `v` by continuity of `f`, so its closure would be
    contained in the closure of `v`, and therefore it would be disjoint from `w`. This is a
    contradiction since `x` belongs both to this closure and to `w`. -/
