# Additive content built from a projective family of measures

Let `P` be a projective family of measures on a family of measurable spaces indexed by `ι`.
That is, for each finite set `I` of indices, `P I` is a measure on `Π j : I, α j`, and for `J ⊆ I`,
the projection from `Π i : I, α i` to `Π i : J, α i` maps `P I` to `P J`.

We build an additive content `projectiveFamilyContent` on the measurable cylinders, by setting
`projectiveFamilyContent s = P I S` for `s = cylinder I S`, where `I` is a finite set of indices
and `S` is a measurable set in `Π i : I, α i`.

This content will be used to define the projective limit of the family of measures `P`.
For a countable index set and a projective family given by a sequence of kernels,
the projective limit is given by the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem.
For an arbitrary index set but under topological conditions on the spaces, this is the result of
the Kolmogorov extension theorem.
(both results are not yet in Mathlib)

## Main definitions

* `projectiveFamilyContent`: additive content on the measurable cylinders, defined from a projective
  family of measures.
