# Radon-Nikodym theorem

This file proves the Radon-Nikodym theorem. The Radon-Nikodym theorem states that, given measures
`μ, ν`, if `HaveLebesgueDecomposition μ ν`, then `μ` is absolutely continuous with respect to
`ν` if and only if there exists a measurable function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞` such that `μ = fν`.
In particular, we have `f = rnDeriv μ ν`.

The Radon-Nikodym theorem will allow us to define many important concepts in probability theory,
most notably probability cumulative functions. It could also be used to define the conditional
expectation of a real function, but we take a different approach (see the file
`MeasureTheory/Function/ConditionalExpectation`).

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.absolutelyContinuous_iff_withDensity_rnDeriv_eq` :
  the Radon-Nikodym theorem
* `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.absolutelyContinuous_iff_withDensityᵥ_rnDeriv_eq` :
  the Radon-Nikodym theorem for signed measures
