# Measurable spaces and measurable functions

This file provides properties of measurable spaces and the functions and isomorphisms between them.
The definition of a measurable space is in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Defs.lean`.

A measurable space is a set equipped with a σ-algebra, a collection of
subsets closed under complementation and countable union. A function
between measurable spaces is measurable if the preimage of each
measurable subset is measurable.

σ-algebras on a fixed set `α` form a complete lattice. Here we order
σ-algebras by writing `m₁ ≤ m₂` if every set which is `m₁`-measurable is
also `m₂`-measurable (that is, `m₁` is a subset of `m₂`). In particular, any
collection of subsets of `α` generates a smallest σ-algebra which
contains all of them. A function `f : α → β` induces a Galois connection
between the lattices of σ-algebras on `α` and `β`.

A measurable equivalence between measurable spaces is an equivalence
which respects the σ-algebras, that is, for which both directions of
the equivalence are measurable functions.

We say that a filter `f` is measurably generated if every set `s ∈ f` includes a measurable
set `t ∈ f`. This property is useful, e.g., to extract a measurable witness of `Filter.Eventually`.

## Notation

* We write `α ≃ᵐ β` for measurable equivalences between the measurable spaces `α` and `β`.
  This should not be confused with `≃ₘ` which is used for diffeomorphisms between manifolds.

## Implementation notes

Measurability of a function `f : α → β` between measurable spaces is
defined in terms of the Galois connection induced by f.

/-- A map `f : α → β` is called a *measurable embedding* if it is injective, measurable, and sends
measurable sets to measurable sets. The latter assumption can be replaced with “`f` has measurable
inverse `g : Set.range f → α`”, see `MeasurableEmbedding.measurable_rangeSplitting`,
`MeasurableEmbedding.of_measurable_inverse_range`, and
`MeasurableEmbedding.of_measurable_inverse`.

One more interpretation: `f` is a measurable embedding if it defines a measurable equivalence to its
range and the range is a measurable set. One implication is formalized as
`MeasurableEmbedding.equivRange`; the other one follows from
`MeasurableEquiv.measurableEmbedding`, `MeasurableEmbedding.subtype_coe`, and
