# Measurable spaces and measurable functions

This file provides properties of measurable spaces and the functions and isomorphisms between them.
The definition of a measurable space is in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Defs.lean`.

A measurable space is a set equipped with a σ-algebra, a collection of subsets closed under
complementation and countable union. A function between measurable spaces is measurable if
the preimage of each measurable subset is measurable.

σ-algebras on a fixed set `α` form a complete lattice. Here we order σ-algebras by writing `m₁ ≤ m₂`
if every set which is `m₁`-measurable is also `m₂`-measurable (that is, `m₁` is a subset of `m₂`).
In particular, any collection of subsets of `α` generates a smallest σ-algebra which contains
all of them. A function `f : α → β` induces a Galois connection between the lattices of σ-algebras
on `α` and `β`.

## Implementation notes

Measurability of a function `f : α → β` between measurable spaces is defined in terms of the
Galois connection induced by `f`.
