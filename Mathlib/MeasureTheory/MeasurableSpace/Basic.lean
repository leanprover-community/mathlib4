# Measurable spaces and measurable functions

This file provides properties of measurable spaces and the functions and isomorphisms between them.
The definition of a measurable space is in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Defs.lean`.

A measurable space is a set equipped with a σ-algebra, a collection of
subsets closed under complementation and countable union. A function
between measurable spaces is measurable if the preimage of each
measurable subset is measurable.

σ-algebras on a fixed set `α` form a complete lattice. Here we order
σ-algebras by writing `m₁ ≤ m₂` if every set which is `m₁`-measurable is
also `m₂`-measurable (that is, `m₁` is a subset of `m₂`). In particular, any
collection of subsets of `α` generates a smallest σ-algebra which
contains all of them. A function `f : α → β` induces a Galois connection
between the lattices of σ-algebras on `α` and `β`.

We say that a filter `f` is measurably generated if every set `s ∈ f` includes a measurable
set `t ∈ f`. This property is useful, e.g., to extract a measurable witness of `Filter.Eventually`.

## Implementation notes

Measurability of a function `f : α → β` between measurable spaces is
defined in terms of the Galois connection induced by f.
