# Measurable embeddings and equivalences

A measurable equivalence between measurable spaces is an equivalence
which respects the σ-algebras, that is, for which both directions of
the equivalence are measurable functions.

## Main definitions

* `MeasurableEmbedding`: a map `f : α → β` is called a *measurable embedding* if it is injective,
  measurable, and sends measurable sets to measurable sets.
* `MeasurableEquiv`: an equivalence `α ≃ β` is a *measurable equivalence* if its forward and inverse
  functions are measurable.

We prove a multitude of elementary lemmas about these, and one more substantial theorem:

* `MeasurableEmbedding.schroederBernstein`: the **measurable Schröder-Bernstein Theorem**: given
  measurable embeddings `α → β` and `β → α`, we can find a measurable equivalence `α ≃ᵐ β`.

## Notation

* We write `α ≃ᵐ β` for measurable equivalences between the measurable spaces `α` and `β`.
  This should not be confused with `≃ₘ` which is used for diffeomorphisms between manifolds.

/-- A map `f : α → β` is called a *measurable embedding* if it is injective, measurable, and sends
measurable sets to measurable sets. The latter assumption can be replaced with “`f` has measurable
inverse `g : Set.range f → α`”, see `MeasurableEmbedding.measurable_rangeSplitting`,
`MeasurableEmbedding.of_measurable_inverse_range`, and
`MeasurableEmbedding.of_measurable_inverse`.

One more interpretation: `f` is a measurable embedding if it defines a measurable equivalence to its
range and the range is a measurable set. One implication is formalized as
`MeasurableEmbedding.equivRange`; the other one follows from
`MeasurableEquiv.measurableEmbedding`, `MeasurableEmbedding.subtype_coe`, and
`MeasurableEmbedding.comp`. -/
