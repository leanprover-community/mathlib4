# Typeclasses for measurability of lattice operations

In this file we define classes `MeasurableSup` and `MeasurableInf` and prove dot-style
lemmas (`Measurable.sup`, `AEMeasurable.sup` etc). For binary operations we define two typeclasses:

- `MeasurableSup` says that both left and right sup are measurable;
- `MeasurableSup₂` says that `fun p : α × α => p.1 ⊔ p.2` is measurable,

and similarly for other binary operations. The reason for introducing these classes is that in case
of topological space `α` equipped with the Borel `σ`-algebra, instances for `MeasurableSup₂`
etc require `α` to have a second countable topology.

For instances relating, e.g., `ContinuousSup` to `MeasurableSup` see file
`MeasureTheory.BorelSpace`.
