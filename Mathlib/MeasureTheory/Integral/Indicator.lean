# Results about indicator functions, their integrals, and measures

This file has a few measure-theoretic or integration-related results on indicator functions.

## Implementation notes

This file exists to avoid importing `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Constructions/BorelSpace/Metrizable.lean`
in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/Lebesgue/Basic.lean`.

## TODO

The result `MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_tendsto_indicator` here could be proved without
integration, if we had convergence of measures results for countably generated filters. Ideally,
the present file would then become unnecessary: lemmas such as
`MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_ae_tendsto_indicator` would not need integration so could be
moved out of `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/Lebesgue/Basic.lean`, and the lemmas in this file could
be moved to, e.g., `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Constructions/BorelSpace/Metrizable.lean`.
