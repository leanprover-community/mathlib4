# Results about indicator functions, their integrals, and measures

This file has a few measure theoretic or integration-related results on indicator functions.

## Implementation notes

This file exists to avoid importing `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.BorelSpace.Metrizable`
in `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Integral.Lebesgue`.

## Todo

The result `MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_tendsto_indicator` here could be proved without
integration, if we had convergence of measures results for countably generated filters. Ideally,
the present file would then become unnecessary: lemmas such as
`MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_ae_tendsto_indicator` would not need integration so could be
moved out of `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Integral.Lebesgue`, and the lemmas in this file could be
moved to, e.g., `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.BorelSpace.Metrizable`.
