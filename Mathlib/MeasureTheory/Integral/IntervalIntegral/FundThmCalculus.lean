# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

We prove various versions of the
[fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus)
for interval integrals in `ℝ`.

Recall that its first version states that the function `(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has derivative
`(δu, δv) ↦ δv • f b - δu • f a` at `(a, b)` provided that `f` is continuous at `a` and `b`,
and its second version states that, if `f` has an integrable derivative on `[a, b]`, then
`∫ x in a..b, f' x = f b - f a`.

## Main statements

### FTC-1 for Lebesgue measure

We prove several versions of FTC-1, all in the `intervalIntegral` namespace. Many of them follow
the naming scheme `integral_has(Strict?)(F?)Deriv(Within?)At(_of_tendsto_ae?)(_right|_left?)`.
They formulate FTC in terms of `Has(Strict?)(F?)Deriv(Within?)At`.
Let us explain the meaning of each part of the name:

* `Strict` means that the theorem is about strict differentiability, see `HasStrictDerivAt` and
  `HasStrictFDerivAt`;
* `F` means that the theorem is about differentiability in both endpoints; incompatible with
  `_right|_left`;
* `Within` means that the theorem is about one-sided derivatives, see below for details;
* `_of_tendsto_ae` means that instead of continuity the theorem assumes that `f` has a finite limit
  almost surely as `x` tends to `a` and/or `b`;
* `_right` or `_left` mean that the theorem is about differentiability in the right (resp., left)
  endpoint.

We also reformulate these theorems in terms of `(f?)deriv(Within?)`. These theorems are named
`(f?)deriv(Within?)_integral(_of_tendsto_ae?)(_right|_left?)` with the same meaning of parts of the
name.

### One-sided derivatives

Theorem `intervalIntegral.integral_hasFDerivWithinAt_of_tendsto_ae` states that
`(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has a derivative `(δu, δv) ↦ δv • cb - δu • ca` within the set `s × t`
at `(a, b)` provided that `f` tends to `ca` (resp., `cb`) almost surely at `la` (resp., `lb`), where
possible values of `s`, `t`, and corresponding filters `la`, `lb` are given in the following table.

| `s`     | `la`     | `t`     | `lb`     |
| ------- | ----     | ---     | ----     |
| `Iic a` | `𝓝[≤] a` | `Iic b` | `𝓝[≤] b` |
| `Ici a` | `𝓝[>] a` | `Ici b` | `𝓝[>] b` |
| `{a}`   | `⊥`      | `{b}`   | `⊥`      |
| `univ`  | `𝓝 a`    | `univ`  | `𝓝 b`    |

We use a typeclass `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter` to make Lean automatically find `la`/`lb` based on
`s`/`t`. This way we can formulate one theorem instead of `16` (or `8` if we leave only non-trivial
ones not covered by `integral_hasDerivWithinAt_of_tendsto_ae_(left|right)` and
`integral_hasFDerivAt_of_tendsto_ae`). Similarly, `integral_hasDerivWithinAt_of_tendsto_ae_right`
works for both one-sided derivatives using the same typeclass to find an appropriate filter.

### FTC for a locally finite measure

Before proving FTC for the Lebesgue measure, we prove a few statements that can be seen as FTC for
any measure. The most general of them,
`measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_isLittleO_of_tendsto_ae`, states the following.
Let `(la, la')` be an `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter` pair of filters around `a` (i.e.,
`intervalIntegral.FTCFilter a la la'`) and let `(lb, lb')` be an `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter` pair
of filters around `b`. If `f` has finite limits `ca` and `cb` almost surely at `la'` and `lb'`,
respectively, then
$$
  \int_{va}^{vb} f ∂μ - \int_{ua}^{ub} f ∂μ =
  \int_{ub}^{vb} cb ∂μ - \int_{ua}^{va} ca ∂μ + o(‖∫_{ua}^{va} 1 ∂μ‖ + ‖∫_{ub}^{vb} (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖)
$$
as `ua` and `va` tend to `la` while `ub` and `vb` tend to `lb`.

### FTC-2 and corollaries

We use FTC-1 to prove several versions of FTC-2 for the Lebesgue measure, using a similar naming
scheme as for the versions of FTC-1. They include:
* `intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDeriv_right_of_le` - most general version, for functions
  with a right derivative
* `intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt` - version for functions with a derivative on
  an open set
* `intervalIntegral.integral_deriv_eq_sub'` - version that is easiest to use when computing the
  integral of a specific function

Many applications of these theorems can be found in the file
`Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Integrals.lean`.

Note that the assumptions of FTC-2 are formulated in the form that `f'` is integrable. To use it in
a context with the stronger assumption that `f'` is continuous, one can use
`ContinuousOn.intervalIntegrable` or `ContinuousOn.integrableOn_Icc` or
`ContinuousOn.integrableOn_uIcc`.

### `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter` class

As explained above, many theorems in this file rely on the typeclass
`intervalIntegral.FTCFilter (a : ℝ) (l l' : Filter ℝ)` to avoid code duplication. This typeclass
combines four assumptions:

- `pure a ≤ l`;
- `l' ≤ 𝓝 a`;
- `l'` has a basis of measurable sets;
- if `u n` and `v n` tend to `l`, then for any `s ∈ l'`, `Ioc (u n) (v n)` is eventually included
  in `s`.

This typeclass has the following “real” instances: `(a, pure a, ⊥)`, `(a, 𝓝[≥] a, 𝓝[>] a)`,
`(a, 𝓝[≤] a, 𝓝[≤] a)`, `(a, 𝓝 a, 𝓝 a)`.
Furthermore, we have the following instances that are equal to the previously mentioned instances:
`(a, 𝓝[{a}] a, ⊥)` and `(a, 𝓝[univ] a, 𝓝[univ] a)`.
While the difference between `Ici a` and `Ioi a` doesn't matter for theorems about Lebesgue measure,
it becomes important in the versions of FTC about any locally finite measure if this measure has an
atom at one of the endpoints.

### Combining one-sided and two-sided derivatives

There are some `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter` instances where the fact that it is one-sided or
two-sided depends on the point, namely `(x, 𝓝[Set.Icc a b] x, 𝓝[Set.Icc a b] x)` (resp.
`(x, 𝓝[Set.uIcc a b] x, 𝓝[Set.uIcc a b] x)`, with `x ∈ Icc a b` (resp. `x ∈ uIcc a b`). This results
in a two-sided derivatives for `x ∈ Set.Ioo a b` and one-sided derivatives for `x ∈ {a, b}`. Other
instances could be added when needed (in that case, one also needs to add instances for
`Filter.IsMeasurablyGenerated` and `Filter.TendstoIxxClass`).

### Fundamental theorem of calculus, part 1, for any measure

In this section we prove a few lemmas that can be seen as versions of FTC-1 for interval integrals
w.r.t. any measure. Many theorems are formulated for one or two pairs of filters related by
`intervalIntegral.FTCFilter a l l'`. This typeclass has exactly four “real” instances:
`(a, pure a, ⊥)`, `(a, 𝓝[≥] a, 𝓝[>] a)`, `(a, 𝓝[≤] a, 𝓝[≤] a)`, `(a, 𝓝 a, 𝓝 a)`, and two instances
that are equal to the first and last “real” instances: `(a, 𝓝[{a}] a, ⊥)` and
`(a, 𝓝[univ] a, 𝓝[univ] a)`.  We use this approach to avoid repeating arguments in many very similar
cases.  Lean can automatically find both `a` and `l'` based on `l`.

The most general theorem `measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_isLittleO_of_tendsto_ae` can be
seen as a generalization of lemma `integral_hasStrictFDerivAt` below which states strict
differentiability of `∫ x in u..v, f x` in `(u, v)` at `(a, b)` for a measurable function `f` that
is integrable on `a..b` and is continuous at `a` and `b`. The lemma is generalized in three
directions: first, `measure_integral_sub_integral_sub_linear_isLittleO_of_tendsto_ae` deals with any
locally finite measure `μ`; second, it works for one-sided limits/derivatives; third, it assumes
only that `f` has finite limits almost surely at `a` and `b`.

Namely, let `f` be a measurable function integrable on `a..b`. Let `(la, la')` be a pair of
`intervalIntegral.FTCFilter`s around `a`; let `(lb, lb')` be a pair of `intervalIntegral.FTCFilter`s
around `b`. Suppose that `f` has finite limits `ca` and `cb` at `la' ⊓ ae μ` and `lb' ⊓ ae μ`,
respectively.  Then
`∫ x in va..vb, f x ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..ub, f x ∂μ = ∫ x in ub..vb, cb ∂μ - ∫ x in ua..va, ca ∂μ +
  o(‖∫ x in ua..va, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖ + ‖∫ x in ub..vb, (1:ℝ) ∂μ‖)`
as `ua` and `va` tend to `la` while `ub` and `vb` tend to `lb`.

This theorem is formulated with integral of constants instead of measures in the right hand sides
for two reasons: first, this way we avoid `min`/`max` in the statements; second, often it is
possible to write better `simp` lemmas for these integrals, see `integral_const` and
`integral_const_of_cdf`.

In the next subsection we apply this theorem to prove various theorems about differentiability
of the integral w.r.t. Lebesgue measure. -/

### Fundamental theorem of calculus-1 for Lebesgue measure

In this section we restate theorems from the previous section for Lebesgue measure.
In particular, we prove that `∫ x in u..v, f x` is strictly differentiable in `(u, v)`
at `(a, b)` provided that `f` is integrable on `a..b` and is continuous at `a` and `b`.

#### Auxiliary `Asymptotics.IsLittleO` statements

In this section we prove several lemmas that can be interpreted as strict differentiability of
`(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x ∂μ` in `u` and/or `v` at a filter. The statements use
`Asymptotics.isLittleO` because we have no definition of `HasStrict(F)DerivAtFilter` in the library.

### Fundamental theorem of calculus, part 2

This section contains theorems pertaining to FTC-2 for interval integrals, i.e., the assertion
that `∫ x in a..b, f' x = f b - f a` under suitable assumptions.

The most classical version of this theorem assumes that `f'` is continuous. However, this is
unnecessarily strong: the result holds if `f'` is just integrable. We prove the strong version,
following [Rudin, *Real and Complex Analysis* (Theorem 7.21)][rudin2006real]. The proof is first
given for real-valued functions, and then deduced for functions with a general target space. For
a real-valued function `g`, it suffices to show that `g b - g a ≤ (∫ x in a..b, g' x) + ε` for all
positive `ε`. To prove this, choose a lower-semicontinuous function `G'` with `g' < G'` and with
integral close to that of `g'` (its existence is guaranteed by the Vitali-Carathéodory theorem).
It satisfies `g t - g a ≤ ∫ x in a..t, G' x` for all `t ∈ [a, b]`: this inequality holds at `a`,
and if it holds at `t` then it holds for `u` close to `t` on its right, as the left hand side
increases by `g u - g t ∼ (u -t) g' t`, while the right hand side increases by
`∫ x in t..u, G' x` which is roughly at least `∫ x in t..u, G' t = (u - t) G' t`, by lower
semicontinuity. As  `g' t < G' t`, this gives the conclusion. One can therefore push progressively
this inequality to the right until the point `b`, where it gives the desired conclusion.
