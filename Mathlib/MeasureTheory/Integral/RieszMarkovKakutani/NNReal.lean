#  Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem for `ℝ≥0`

This file proves the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem on a locally compact
T2 space `X` for `ℝ≥0`-linear functionals `Λ`.

## Implementation notes

The proof depends on the version of the theorem for `ℝ`-linear functional Λ because in a standard
proof one has to prove the inequalities by `le_antisymm`, yet for `C_c(X, ℝ≥0)` there is no `Neg`.
Here we prove the result by writing `ℝ≥0`-linear `Λ` in terms of `ℝ`-linear `toRealLinear Λ` and by
reducing the statement to the `ℝ`-version of the theorem.
