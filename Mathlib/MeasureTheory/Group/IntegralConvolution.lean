# Bochner integrals of convolutions

This file contains results about the Bochner integrals of convolutions of measures.

These results are not placed in the main convolution file because we don't want to import Bochner
integrals over there.

## Main statements

* `integrable_conv_iff`: A function is integrable with respect to the convolution `μ ∗ ν` iff
  the function `y ↦ f (x + y)` is integrable with respect to `ν` for `μ`-almost every `x` and
  the function `x ↦ ∫ y, ‖f (x + y)‖ ∂ν` is integrable with respect to `μ`.
* `integral_conv`: if `f` is integrable with respect to the convolution `μ ∗ ν`, then
  `∫ x, f x ∂(μ ∗ ν) = ∫ x, ∫ y, f (x + y) ∂ν ∂μ`.
