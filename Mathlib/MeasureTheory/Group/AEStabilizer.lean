# A.e. stabilizer of a set

In this file we define the a.e. stabilizer of a set under a measure preserving group action.

The a.e. stabilizer `MulAction.aestabilizer G μ s` of a set `s`
is the set of the elements `g : G` such that `s` is a.e.-invariant under `(g • ·)`.

For a measure preserving group action, this set is a subgroup of `G`.
If the set is null or conull, then this subgroup is the whole group.
The converse is true for an ergodic action and a null-measurable set.

## Implementation notes

We define the a.e. stabilizer as a bundled `Subgroup`,
thus we do not deal with monoid actions.

Also, many lemmas in this file are true for a *quasi measure-preserving* action,
but we don't have the corresponding typeclass.
