# The multiplicative and additive convolution of measures

In this file we define and prove properties about the convolutions of two measures.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.mconv`: The multiplicative convolution of two measures: the map of `*`
  under the product measure.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.conv`: The additive convolution of two measures: the map of `+`
  under the product measure.
