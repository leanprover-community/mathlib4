# Typeclasses for measurability of operations

In this file we define classes `MeasurableMul` etc and prove dot-style lemmas
(`Measurable.mul`, `AEMeasurable.mul` etc). For binary operations we define two typeclasses:

- `MeasurableMul` says that both left and right multiplication are measurable;
- `MeasurableMul₂` says that `fun p : α × α => p.1 * p.2` is measurable,

and similarly for other binary operations. The reason for introducing these classes is that in case
of topological space `α` equipped with the Borel `σ`-algebra, instances for `MeasurableMul₂`
etc require `α` to have a second countable topology.

We define separate classes for `MeasurableDiv`/`MeasurableSub`
because on some types (e.g., `ℕ`, `ℝ≥0∞`) division and/or subtraction are not defined as `a * b⁻¹` /
`a + (-b)`.

For instances relating, e.g., `ContinuousMul` to `MeasurableMul` see file
`MeasureTheory.BorelSpace`.

## Implementation notes

For the heuristics of `@[to_additive]` it is important that the type with a multiplication
(or another multiplicative operations) is the first (implicit) argument of all declarations.

## Tags

measurable function, arithmetic operator

## Todo

* Uniformize the treatment of `pow` and `smul`.
* Use `@[to_additive]` to send `MeasurablePow` to `MeasurableSMul₂`.
* This might require changing the definition (swapping the arguments in the function that is
  in the conclusion of `MeasurableSMul`.)
