# Modular character of a locally compact group

On a locally compact group, there is a natural homomorphism `G → ℝ≥0*`, which for `g : G` gives the
value `μ (· * g⁻¹) / μ`, where `μ` is an (inner regular) Haar measure. This file defines this
homomorphism, called the modular character, and shows that it is independent of the chosen Haar
measure.

TODO: Show that the character is continuous.

## Main Declarations

* `modularCharacterFun`: Define the modular character function. If `μ` is a left Haar measure on `G`
  and `g : G`, the measure `A ↦ μ (A g⁻¹)` is also a left Haar measure, so by uniqueness is of the
  form `Δ(g) μ`, for `Δ(g) ∈ ℝ≥0`. This `Δ` is the modular character. The result that this does not
  depend on the measure chosen is `modularCharacterFun_eq_haarScalarFactor`.
* `modularCharacter`: The homomorphism G →* ℝ≥0 whose toFun is `modularCharacterFun`.
