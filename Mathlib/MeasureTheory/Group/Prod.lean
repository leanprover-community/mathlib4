# Measure theory in the product of groups
In this file we show properties about measure theory in products of measurable groups
and properties of iterated integrals in measurable groups.

These lemmas show the uniqueness of left invariant measures on measurable groups, up to
scaling. In this file we follow the proof and refer to the book *Measure Theory* by Paul Halmos.

The idea of the proof is to use the translation invariance of measures to prove `μ(t) = c * μ(s)`
for two sets `s` and `t`, where `c` is a constant that does not depend on `μ`. Let `e` and `f` be
the characteristic functions of `s` and `t`.
Assume that `μ` and `ν` are left-invariant measures. Then the map `(x, y) ↦ (y * x, x⁻¹)`
preserves the measure `μ × ν`, which means that
```
  ∫ x, ∫ y, h x y ∂ν ∂μ = ∫ x, ∫ y, h (y * x) x⁻¹ ∂ν ∂μ
```
If we apply this to `h x y := e x * f y⁻¹ / ν ((fun h ↦ h * y⁻¹) ⁻¹' s)`, we can rewrite the RHS to
`μ(t)`, and the LHS to `c * μ(s)`, where `c = c(ν)` does not depend on `μ`.
Applying this to `μ` and to `ν` gives `μ (t) / μ (s) = ν (t) / ν (s)`, which is the uniqueness up to
scalar multiplication.

The proof in [Halmos] seems to contain an omission in §60 Th. A, see
`MeasureTheory.measure_lintegral_div_measure`.

Note that this theory only applies in measurable groups, i.e., when multiplication and inversion
are measurable. This is not the case in general in locally compact groups, or even in compact
groups, when the topology is not second-countable. For arguments along the same line, but using
continuous functions instead of measurable sets and working in the general locally compact
setting, see the file `MeasureTheory.Measure.Haar.Unique.lean`.
