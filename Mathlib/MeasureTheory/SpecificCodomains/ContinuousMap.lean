# Specific results about `ContinuousMap`-valued integration

In this file, we collect a few results regarding integrability, on a measure space `(X, μ)`,
of a `C(Y, E)`-valued function, where `Y` is a compact topological space and `E` is a normed group.

These are all elementary from a mathematical point of view, but they require a bit of care in order
to be conveniently usable. In particular, to accomodate the need of families `f : X → Y → E` which
such that `f x` is only continuous for *almost every* `x`, we give a variety of results about the
integrability of `fun x ↦ ContinuousMap.mkD (f x) g` whose assumption only mention `f` (so that
user don't have to convert between `f` and `fun x ↦ ContinuousMap.mkD (f x) g` by hand).

## Main results

* `hasFiniteIntegral_of_bound`: given `f : X → C(Y, E)`, the natural way to show
  `HasFiniteIntegral f` is to give a `bound : X → ℝ`, which itself has finite integral, and such
  that `∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ∀ y : Y, ‖f x y‖ ≤ bound x`.
* `hasFiniteIntegral_mkD_of_bound` is the `mkD` analog of the above: given `f : X → Y → E` such
  that `f x` is continuous for almost every `x`, as well as a bound as above, we prove
  `HasFiniteIntegral (fun x ↦ mkD (f x) g)`. Note that, conveniently, `mkD` only appears in the
  result.
* `aeStronglyMeasurable_mkD_of_uncurry`: if now `X` is a topological space with the borel σ-algebra,
  and `f : X → Y → E` is continuous on `X × Y`, then `fun x ↦ mkD (f x) g` is
  `AEStronglyMeasurable`. Note that this is far from optimal: this function is in fact continuous,
  and one could avoid `mkD` entirely since `f x` is always continuous in that case. Nevertheless,
  this turns out to be most convenient, as we explain below.

## Implementation Note

We claim that using "constructors with default values" such as `ContinuousMap.mkD` is the right way
to approach integration valued in a functional space `ℱ`. More precisely:

- if you happen to start from a bundled `f : X → ℱ` function, you should be able to use
  the general theory without any issues.
- if instead you start with a family of bare functions `f : X → Y → E`, to integrate it in `ℱ`, you
  should always consider the family `fun x ↦ ℱ.mkD (f x) 0`, *even if your `f` always lands in `ℱ`*.
  This allows for a unified setting with the case where `f x` belongs to `ℱ` for *almost every `x`*,
  and also avoids entering dependent-types hell.

/-- A natural criterion for `HasFiniteIntegral` of a `C(Y, E)`-valued function is the existence
of some positive function with finite integral such that `∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ∀ y : Y, ‖f x y‖ ≤ bound x`.
Note that there is no dominated convergence here (hence no first-countability assumption
on `Y`). We are just using the properties of Banach-space-valued integration. -/
