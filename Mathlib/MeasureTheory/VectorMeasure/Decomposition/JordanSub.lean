# Jordan decomposition from signed measure subtraction

This file develops the Jordan decomposition of the signed measure `μ - ν` for finite measures `μ`
and `ν`, expressing it as the pair `(μ - ν, ν - μ)` of mutually singular finite measures.

The key tool is the Hahn decomposition theorem, which yields a measurable partition of the space
where `μ ≤ ν` and `ν ≤ μ`, and the measure difference behaves like a signed measure difference.

## Main results

* `toJordanDecomposition_toSignedMeasure_sub`:
  The Jordan decomposition of `μ.toSignedMeasure - ν.toSignedMeasure` is given by
  `(μ - ν, ν - μ)`. It relies on the following intermediate results.
* `mutually_singular_measure_sub`:
  The measures `μ - ν` and `ν - μ` are mutually singular.
* `sub_toSignedMeasure_eq_toSignedMeasure_sub`:
  The signed measure `μ.toSignedMeasure - ν.toSignedMeasure` equals
  `(μ - ν).toSignedMeasure - (ν - μ).toSignedMeasure`.
