# Lebesgue measure on `ℂ`

In this file, we consider the Lebesgue measure on `ℂ` defined as the push-forward of the volume
on `ℝ²` under the natural isomorphism and prove that it is equal to the measure `volume` of `ℂ`
coming from its `InnerProductSpace` structure over `ℝ`. For that, we consider the two frequently
used ways to represent `ℝ²` in `mathlib`: `ℝ × ℝ` and `Fin 2 → ℝ`, define measurable equivalences
(`MeasurableEquiv`) to both types and prove that both of them are volume preserving (in the sense
of `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving`).
