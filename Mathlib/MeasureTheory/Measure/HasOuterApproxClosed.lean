# Spaces where indicators of closed sets have decreasing approximations by continuous functions

In this file we define a typeclass `HasOuterApproxClosed` for topological spaces in which indicator
functions of closed sets have sequences of bounded continuous functions approximating them from
above. All pseudo-emetrizable spaces have this property, see `instHasOuterApproxClosed`.

In spaces with the `HasOuterApproxClosed` property, finite Borel measures are uniquely characterized
by the integrals of bounded continuous functions. Also weak convergence of finite measures and
convergence in distribution for random variables behave somewhat well in spaces with this property.

## Main definitions

 * `HasOuterApproxClosed`: the typeclass for topological spaces in which indicator functions of
   closed sets have sequences of bounded continuous functions approximating them.
 * `IsClosed.apprSeq`: a (non-constructive) choice of an approximating sequence to the indicator
   function of a closed set.

## Main results

 * `instHasOuterApproxClosed`: Any pseudo-emetrizable space has the property `HasOuterApproxClosed`.
 * `tendsto_lintegral_apprSeq`: The integrals of the approximating functions to the indicator of a
   closed set tend to the measure of the set.
 * `ext_of_forall_lintegral_eq_of_IsFiniteMeasure`: Two finite measures are equal if the integrals
   of all bounded continuous functions with respect to both agree.

/-- A bounded convergence theorem for a finite measure:
If bounded continuous non-negative functions are uniformly bounded by a constant and tend to a
limit, then their integrals against the finite measure tend to the integral of the limit.
This formulation assumes:
 * the functions tend to a limit along a countably generated filter;
 * the limit is in the almost everywhere sense;
 * boundedness holds almost everywhere;
 * integration is `MeasureTheory.lintegral`, i.e., the functions and their integrals are
   `ℝ≥0∞`-valued.
