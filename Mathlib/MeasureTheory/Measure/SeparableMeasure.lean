# Separable measure

The goal of this file is to give a sufficient condition on the measure space `(X, μ)` and the
`NormedAddCommGroup E` for the space `MeasureTheory.Lp E p μ` to have `SecondCountableTopology` when
`1 ≤ p < ∞`. To do so we define the notion of a `MeasureTheory.MeasureDense` family and a
separable measure (`MeasureTheory.IsSeparable`).
We prove that if `X` is `MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated` and `μ` is s-finite, then `μ`
is separable. We then prove that if `μ` is separable and `E` is second-countable,
then `Lp E p μ` is second-countable.

A family `𝒜` of subsets of `X` is said to be **measure-dense** if it contains only measurable sets
and can approximate any measurable set with finite measure, in the sense that
for any measurable set `s` such that `μ s ≠ ∞`, `μ (s ∆ t)` can be made
arbitrarily small when `t ∈ 𝒜`. We show below that such a family can be chosen to contain only
sets with finite measure.
The term "measure-dense" is justified by the fact that the approximating condition translates
to the usual notion of density in the metric space made by constant indicators of measurable sets
equipped with the `Lᵖ` norm.

A measure `μ` is **separable** if it admits a countable and measure-dense family of sets.
The term "separable" is justified by the fact that the definition translates to the usual notion
of separability in the metric space made by constant indicators equipped with the `Lᵖ` norm.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.MeasureDense μ 𝒜`: `𝒜` is a measure-dense family if it only contains
  measurable sets and if the following condition is satisfied: if `s` is measurable with finite
  measure, then for any `ε > 0` there exists `t ∈ 𝒜` such that `μ (s ∆ t) < ε `.
* `MeasureTheory.IsSeparable`: A measure is separable if there exists a countable and
  measure-dense family.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.instSecondCountableLp`: If `μ` is separable, `E` is second-countable and
  `1 ≤ p < ∞` then `Lp E p μ` is second-countable. This is in particular true if `X` is countably
  generated and `μ` is s-finite.

## Implementation notes

Through the whole file we consider a measurable space `X` equipped with a measure `μ`, and also
a normed commutative group `E`. We also consider an extended non-negative real `p` such that
`1 ≤ p < ∞`. This is registered as instances via `one_le_p : Fact (1 ≤ p)` and
`p_ne_top : Fact (p ≠ ∞)`, so the properties are accessible via `one_le_p.elim` and `p_ne_top.elim`.

Through the whole file, when we write that an extended non-negative real is finite, it is always
written `≠ ∞` rather than `< ∞`. See `Ne.lt_top` and `ne_of_lt` to switch from one to the other.

/-! ### Definition of a measure-dense family, basic properties and sufficient conditions -/

/-- A family `𝒜` of sets of a measure space is said to be measure-dense if it contains only
measurable sets and can approximate any measurable set with finite measure, in the sense that
for any measurable set `s` with finite measure the symmetric difference `s ∆ t` can be made
arbitrarily small when `t ∈ 𝒜`. We show below that such a family can be chosen to contain only
sets with finite measures.

The term "measure-dense" is justified by the fact that the approximating condition translates
to the usual notion of density in the metric space made by constant indicators of measurable sets
equipped with the `Lᵖ` norm. -/

/-! ### Definition of a separable measure space, sufficient condition -/

/-- A measure `μ` is separable if there exists a countable and measure-dense family of sets.

The term "separable" is justified by the fact that the definition translates to the usual notion
