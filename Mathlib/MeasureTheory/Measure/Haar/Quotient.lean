# Haar quotient measure

In this file, we consider properties of fundamental domains and measures for the action of a
subgroup of a group `G` on `G` itself.

## Main results

* `measure_theory.is_fundamental_domain.smul_invariant_measure_map `: given a subgroup `Γ` of a
  topological group `G`, the pushforward to the coset space `G ⧸ Γ` of the restriction of a both
  left- and right-invariant measure on `G` to a fundamental domain `𝓕` is a `G`-invariant measure
  on `G ⧸ Γ`.

* `measure_theory.is_fundamental_domain.is_mul_left_invariant_map `: given a normal subgroup `Γ` of
  a topological group `G`, the pushforward to the quotient group `G ⧸ Γ` of the restriction of
  a both left- and right-invariant measure on `G` to a fundamental domain `𝓕` is a left-invariant
  measure on `G ⧸ Γ`.

Note that a group `G` with Haar measure that is both left and right invariant is called
**unimodular**.
