# The Giry monad

Let X be a measurable space. The collection of all measures on X again
forms a measurable space. This construction forms a monad on
measurable spaces and measurable functions, called the Giry monad.

Note that most sources use the term "Giry monad" for the restriction
to *probability* measures. Here we include all measures on X.

See also `MeasureTheory/Category/MeasCat.lean`, containing an upgrade of the type-level
monad to an honest monad of the functor `measure : MeasCat ⥤ MeasCat`.
