# Absolute Continuity of Measures

We say that `μ` is absolutely continuous with respect to `ν`, or that `μ` is dominated by `ν`,
if `ν(A) = 0` implies that `μ(A) = 0`. We denote that by `μ ≪ ν`.

It is equivalent to an inequality of the almost everywhere filters of the measures:
`μ ≪ ν ↔ ae μ ≤ ae ν`.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.AbsolutelyContinuous μ ν`: `μ` is absolutely continuous with respect to `ν`

## Main statements

* `ae_le_iff_absolutelyContinuous`: `ae μ ≤ ae ν ↔ μ ≪ ν`

## Notation

* `μ ≪ ν`: `MeasureTheory.Measure.AbsolutelyContinuous μ ν`. That is: `μ` is absolutely continuous
  with respect to `ν`
