# Continuity of the preimage of a set under a measure-preserving continuous function

In this file we prove that the preimage of a null measurable set `s : Set Y`
under a measure-preserving continuous function `f : C(X, Y)` is continuous in `f`
in the sense that `μ ((f a ⁻¹' s) ∆ (g ⁻¹' s))` tends to zero as `f a` tends to `g`.

As a corollary, we show that
for a continuous family of continuous maps `f z : C(X, Y)`,
a null measurable set `s`, and a null measurable set `t` of finite measure,
the set of parameters `z` such that `f z ⁻¹' t` is a.e. equal to `s` is a closed set.

/-- Let `X` and `Y` be R₁ topological spaces
with Borel σ-algebras and measures `μ` and `ν`, respectively.
Suppose that `μ` is inner regular for finite measure sets with respect to compact sets
and `ν` is a locally finite measure.
Let `f : α → C(X, Y)` be a family of continuous maps
that converges to a continuous map `g : C(X, Y)` in the compact-open topology along a filter `l`.
Suppose that `g` is a measure-preserving map
and `f a` is a measure-preserving map eventually along `l`.
Then for any finite measure measurable set `s`,
the preimages `f a ⁻¹' s` tend to the preimage `g ⁻¹' s` in measure.
More precisely, the measure of the symmetric difference of these two sets tends to zero. -/

/-- Let `f : Z → C(X, Y)` be a continuous (in the compact open topology) family
of continuous measure-preserving maps.
Let `t : Set Y` be a null measurable set of finite measure.
Then for any `s`, the set of parameters `z`
such that the preimage of `t` under `f_z` is a.e. equal to `s`
is a closed set.

In particular, if `X = Y` and `s = t`,
then we see that the a.e. stabilizer of a set is a closed set. -/
