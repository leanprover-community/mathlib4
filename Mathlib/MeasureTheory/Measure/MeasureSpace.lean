# Measure spaces

The definition of a measure and a measure space are in `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpaceDef`, with
only a few basic properties. This file provides many more properties of these objects.
This separation allows the measurability tactic to import only the file `MeasureSpaceDef`, and to
be available in `MeasureSpace` (through `MeasurableSpace`).

Given a measurable space `α`, a measure on `α` is a function that sends measurable sets to the
extended nonnegative reals that satisfies the following conditions:
1. `μ ∅ = 0`;
2. `μ` is countably additive. This means that the measure of a countable union of pairwise disjoint
   sets is equal to the measure of the individual sets.

Every measure can be canonically extended to an outer measure, so that it assigns values to
all subsets, not just the measurable subsets. On the other hand, a measure that is countably
additive on measurable sets can be restricted to measurable sets to obtain a measure.
In this file a measure is defined to be an outer measure that is countably additive on
measurable sets, with the additional assumption that the outer measure is the canonical
extension of the restricted measure.

Measures on `α` form a complete lattice, and are closed under scalar multiplication with `ℝ≥0∞`.

Given a measure, the null sets are the sets where `μ s = 0`, where `μ` denotes the corresponding
outer measure (so `s` might not be measurable). We can then define the completion of `μ` as the
measure on the least `σ`-algebra that also contains all null sets, by defining the measure to be `0`
on the null sets.

## Main statements

* `completion` is the completion of a measure to all null measurable sets.
* `Measure.ofMeasurable` and `OuterMeasure.toMeasure` are two important ways to define a measure.

## Implementation notes

Given `μ : Measure α`, `μ s` is the value of the *outer measure* applied to `s`.
This conveniently allows us to apply the measure to sets without proving that they are measurable.
We get countable subadditivity for all sets, but only countable additivity for measurable sets.

You often don't want to define a measure via its constructor.
Two ways that are sometimes more convenient:
* `Measure.ofMeasurable` is a way to define a measure by only giving its value on measurable sets
  and proving the properties (1) and (2) mentioned above.
* `OuterMeasure.toMeasure` is a way of obtaining a measure from an outer measure by showing that
  all measurable sets in the measurable space are Carathéodory measurable.

To prove that two measures are equal, there are multiple options:
* `ext`: two measures are equal if they are equal on all measurable sets.
* `ext_of_generateFrom_of_iUnion`: two measures are equal if they are equal on a π-system generating
  the measurable sets, if the π-system contains a spanning increasing sequence of sets where the
  measures take finite value (in particular the measures are σ-finite). This is a special case of
  the more general `ext_of_generateFrom_of_cover`
* `ext_of_generate_finite`: two finite measures are equal if they are equal on a π-system
  generating the measurable sets. This is a special case of `ext_of_generateFrom_of_iUnion` using
  `C ∪ {univ}`, but is easier to work with.

A `MeasureSpace` is a class that is a measurable space with a canonical measure.
The measure is denoted `volume`.

/-! For the next theorem, the countability assumption is necessary. For a counterexample, consider
an uncountable space, with a distinguished point `x₀`, and the sigma-algebra made of countable sets
not containing `x₀`, and their complements. All points but `x₀` are measurable.
Consider the sum of the Dirac masses at points different from `x₀`, and `s = {x₀}`. For any Dirac
mass `δ_x`, we have `δ_x (x₀) = 0`, so `∑' x, δ_x (x₀) = 0`. On the other hand, the measure
`sum δ_x` gives mass one to each point different from `x₀`, so it gives infinite mass to any
measurable set containing `x₀` (as such a set is uncountable), and by outer regularity one gets
`sum δ_x {x₀} = ∞`.
