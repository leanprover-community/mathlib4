# Prokhorov theorem

We prove statements about the compactness of sets of finite measures or probability measures,
notably several versions of Prokhorov theorem on tight sets of probability measures.

## Main statements

* `instCompactSpaceProbabilityMeasure` proves that the space of probability measures on a compact
space is itself compact
* `isCompact_setOf_probabilityMeasure_mass_eq_compl_isCompact_le`: Given a sequence of compact
  sets `Kₙ` and a sequence `uₙ` tending to zero, the probability measures giving mass at most `uₙ`
  to the complement of `Kₙ` form a compact set.
* `isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet`: Given a tight set of probability measures, its closure
  is compact.

Versions are also given for finite measures.

## Implementation

We do not assume second-countability or metrizability.

For the compactness of the space of probability measures in a compact space, we argue that every
ultrafilter converges, using the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem to construct the limiting measure
in terms of its integrals against continuous functions.

For Prokhorov theorem `isCompact_setOf_probabilityMeasure_mass_eq_compl_isCompact_le`,
we rely on the compactness of the space of measures inside each compact set to get convergence
of the restriction there, and argue that the full measure converges to the sum of the individual
limits of the disjointed components. There is a subtlety that the space of finite measures
giving mass `uₙ` to `Kₙᶜ` doesn't have to be closed in our general setting, but we only need to
find *a* limit satisfying this condition. To ensure this, we need a technical condition
(monotonicity of `K` or normality of the space). In the first case, the bound follows readily
from the construction. In the second case, we modify the individual limits
(again using Riesz-Markov-Kakutani) to make sure that they are inner-regular, and then one can
check the condition.

  /- To prove the compactness, we will show that any sequence has a converging subsequence, in
  ultrafilters terms as things are not second countable. The integral against any bounded continuous
  function has a limit along the ultrafilter, by compactness of real intervals and the mass control.
  The limit is a monotone linear form. By the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, it comes from a
  measure. This measure is finite, of mass at most `C`. It provides the desired limit
  for the ultrafilter. -/

  /- Consider a sequence of measures with mass at most `C` and giving mass at most `uₙ` to `Kₙᶜ`,
  for which we want to find a converging subsequence.
  We want to write `⋃ n, Kₙ` as the disjoint union of `disjointed K n`, restrict the measures to
  each of these sets (which is contained in the compact set `Kₙ`), extract a converging subsequence
  there, to a limit `νₙ`, and then argue that the sequence converges to `μ := ∑ νₙ`.
  We will implement this rough idea, but there are two technical complications.
  First, we should not use a sequence and subsequences, but a ultrafilter as things are not second
  countable.
  Second, it is not obvious that the limit will satisfy the inequality `μ (Kₙᶜ) ≤ uₙ`, as this is
  not a closed condition in the space of measures in general (note that we are not assuming that
  our space is metrizable). To check this inequality, we need the technical condition that the
  space is normal or the sequence `K` is monotone. When the space is normal, the inequality can be
  proved from the weak convergence if we can ensure additionally that `μ` is
  inner regular. We will guarantee this by making sure each `νₙ` is inner regular. When the
  sequence `K` is monotone, on the other hand, the bound readily follows from the construction.

  · -- to show that `μ (Kₙᶜ) ≤ uₙ` when the sequence `K` is monotone, we argue that the only
    -- contribution to `μ (Kₙᶜ)` comes from the measures `νᵢ` with `i > n`. Then we restrict to
    -- a finite sum `∑ i ∈ Ioc n m, νᵢ`, and argue that it is the limit of
    -- `∑ i ∈ Ioc n m, ρ.restricted (K i \ K(i - 1))`, i.e., `ρ.restricted (K m \ K n)`. The total
    -- mass converges (thanks to the weak convergence of finite sums), and the total mass of
