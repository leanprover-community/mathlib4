# Everywhere positive sets in measure spaces

A set `s` in a topological space with a measure `μ` is *everywhere positive* (also called
*self-supporting*) if any neighborhood `n` of any point of `s` satisfies `μ (s ∩ n) > 0`.

## Main definitions and results

* `μ.IsEverywherePos s` registers that, for any point in `s`, all its neighborhoods have positive
  measure inside `s`.
* `μ.everywherePosSubset s` is the subset of `s` made of those points all of whose neighborhoods
  have positive measure inside `s`.
* `everywherePosSubset_ae_eq` shows that `s` and `μ.everywherePosSubset s` coincide almost
  everywhere if `μ` is inner regular and `s` is measurable.
* `isEverywherePos_everywherePosSubset` shows that `μ.everywherePosSubset s` satisfies the property
  `μ.IsEverywherePos` if `μ` is inner regular and `s` is measurable.

The latter two statements have also versions when `μ` is inner regular for finite measure sets,
assuming additionally that `s` has finite measure.

* `IsEverywherePos.IsGδ` proves that an everywhere positive compact closed set is a Gδ set,
  in a topological group with a left-invariant measure. This is a nontrivial statement, used
  crucially in the study of the uniqueness of Haar measures.
* `innerRegularWRT_preimage_one_hasCompactSupport_measure_ne_top`: for a Haar measure, any
  finite measure set can be approximated from inside by level sets of continuous
  compactly supported functions. This property is also known as completion-regularity of Haar
  measures.

/-- If a compact closed set is everywhere positive with respect to a left-invariant measure on a
topological group, then it is a Gδ set. This is nontrivial, as there is no second-countability or
metrizability assumption in the statement, so a general compact closed set has no reason to be
a countable intersection of open sets. -/

    {k : Set G} (h : μ.IsEverywherePos k) (hk : IsCompact k) (h'k : IsClosed k) :
    IsGδ k := by
  /- Consider a decreasing sequence of open neighborhoods `Vₙ` of the identity, such that `g k \ k`
  has small measure for all `g ∈ Vₙ`. We claim that `k = ⋂ Vₙ k`, which proves
  the lemma as the sets on the right are open. The inclusion `⊆` is trivial.
  Let us show the converse. Take `x` in the intersection. For each `n`, write `x = vₙ yₙ` with
  `vₙ ∈ Vₙ` and `yₙ ∈ k`. Let `z ∈ k` be a cluster value of `yₙ`, by compactness. As multiplication
  by `vₙ = x yₙ⁻¹ ∈ Vₙ` changes the measure of `k` by very little, passing to the limit we get
  `μ (x z⁻¹ k \ k) = 0`. By invariance of the measure under `z x ⁻¹`, we get `μ (k \ z x⁻¹ k) = 0`.
  Assume `x ∉ k`. Then `z ∈ k \ z x⁻¹ k`. Even more, this set is a neighborhood of `z` within `k`
  (as `z x⁻¹ k` is closed), and it has zero measure. This contradicts the fact that `k` has
  positive measure around the point `z`. -/
