# Measure spaces

This file defines measure spaces, the almost-everywhere filter and ae_measurable functions.
See `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace` for their properties and for extended documentation.

Given a measurable space `α`, a measure on `α` is a function that sends measurable sets to the
extended nonnegative reals that satisfies the following conditions:
1. `μ ∅ = 0`;
2. `μ` is countably additive. This means that the measure of a countable union of pairwise disjoint
   sets is equal to the sum of the measures of the individual sets.

Every measure can be canonically extended to an outer measure, so that it assigns values to
all subsets, not just the measurable subsets. On the other hand, an outer measure that is countably
additive on measurable sets can be restricted to measurable sets to obtain a measure.
In this file a measure is defined to be an outer measure that is countably additive on
measurable sets, with the additional assumption that the outer measure is the canonical
extension of the restricted measure.

Measures on `α` form a complete lattice, and are closed under scalar multiplication with `ℝ≥0∞`.

## Implementation notes

Given `μ : Measure α`, `μ s` is the value of the *outer measure* applied to `s`.
This conveniently allows us to apply the measure to sets without proving that they are measurable.
We get countable subadditivity for all sets, but only countable additivity for measurable sets.

See the documentation of `MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace` for ways to construct measures and proving
that two measure are equal.

A `MeasureSpace` is a class that is a measurable space with a canonical measure.
The measure is denoted `volume`.

This file does not import `MeasureTheory.MeasurableSpace.Basic`, but only `MeasurableSpace.Defs`.
