# Characterizations of weak convergence of finite measures and probability measures

This file will provide portmanteau characterizations of the weak convergence of finite measures
and of probability measures, i.e., the standard characterizations of convergence in distribution.

## Main definitions

The topologies of weak convergence on the types of finite measures and probability measures are
already defined in their corresponding files; no substantial new definitions are introduced here.

## Main results

The main result will be the portmanteau theorem providing various characterizations of the
weak convergence of measures (probability measures or finite measures). Given measures μs
and μ on a topological space Ω, the conditions that will be proven equivalent (under quite
general hypotheses) are:

  (T) The measures μs tend to the measure μ weakly.
  (C) For any closed set F, the limsup of the measures of F under μs is at most
      the measure of F under μ, i.e., limsupᵢ μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F).
  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μs is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfᵢ μsᵢ(G).
  (B) For any Borel set B whose boundary carries no mass under μ, i.e. μ(∂B) = 0,
      the measures of B under μs tend to the measure of B under μ, i.e., limᵢ μsᵢ(B) = μ(B).

The separate implications are:
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto` is the implication (T) → (C).
* `MeasureTheory.limsup_measure_closed_le_iff_liminf_measure_open_ge` is the equivalence (C) ↔ (O).
* `MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier` is the implication (O) → (B).
* `MeasureTheory.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_forall_tendsto_measure` is the implication (B) → (C).
* `MeasureTheory.tendsto_of_forall_isOpen_le_liminf` gives the implication (O) → (T) for
    any sequence of Borel probability measures.

## Implementation notes

Many of the characterizations of weak convergence hold for finite measures and are proven in that
generality and then specialized to probability measures. Some implications hold with slightly
more general assumptions than in the usual statement of portmanteau theorem. The full portmanteau
theorem, however, is most convenient for probability measures on pseudo-emetrizable spaces with
their Borel sigma algebras.

Some specific considerations on the assumptions in the different implications:
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto`, i.e., implication (T) → (C),
  assumes that in the underlying topological space, indicator functions of closed sets have
  decreasing bounded continuous pointwise approximating sequences. The assumption is in the form
  of the type class `HasOuterApproxClosed`. Type class inference knows that for example the more
  common assumptions of metrizability or pseudo-emetrizability suffice.
* Where formulations are currently only provided for probability measures, one can obtain the
  finite measure formulations using the characterization of convergence of finite measures by
  their total masses and their probability-normalized versions, i.e., by
  `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.tendsto_normalize_iff_tendsto`.

/-! ### Portmanteau: limsup condition for closed sets iff liminf condition for open sets

In this section we prove that for a sequence of Borel probability measures on a topological space
and its candidate limit measure, the following two conditions are equivalent:

  (C) For any closed set F, the limsup of the measures of F under μs is at most
      the measure of F under μ, i.e., limsupᵢ μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F);
  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μs is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfᵢ μsᵢ(G).

Either of these will later be shown to be equivalent to the weak convergence of the sequence
of measures.

/-! ### Portmanteau implication: liminf condition for open sets implies weak convergence


In this section we prove for a sequence (μsₙ)ₙ Borel probability measures that

  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μsₙ is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfₙ μsₙ(G).

implies

  (T) The measures μsₙ converge weakly to the measure μ.
