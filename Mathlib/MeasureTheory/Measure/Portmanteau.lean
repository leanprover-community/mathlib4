# Characterizations of weak convergence of finite measures and probability measures

This file will provide portmanteau characterizations of the weak convergence of finite measures
and of probability measures, i.e., the standard characterizations of convergence in distribution.

## Main definitions

The topologies of weak convergence on the types of finite measures and probability measures are
already defined in their corresponding files; no substantial new definitions are introduced here.

## Main results

The main result will be the portmanteau theorem providing various characterizations of the
weak convergence of measures (probability measures or finite measures). Given measures μs
and μ on a topological space Ω, the conditions that will be proven equivalent (under quite
general hypotheses) are:

  (T) The measures μs tend to the measure μ weakly.
  (C) For any closed set F, the limsup of the measures of F under μs is at most
      the measure of F under μ, i.e., limsupᵢ μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F).
  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μs is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfᵢ μsᵢ(G).
  (B) For any Borel set B whose boundary carries no mass under μ, i.e. μ(∂B) = 0,
      the measures of B under μs tend to the measure of B under μ, i.e., limᵢ μsᵢ(B) = μ(B).

The separate implications are:
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto` is the implication (T) → (C).
* `MeasureTheory.limsup_measure_closed_le_iff_liminf_measure_open_ge` is the equivalence (C) ↔ (O).
* `MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier` is the implication (O) → (B).
* `MeasureTheory.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_forall_tendsto_measure` is the implication (B) → (C).
* `MeasureTheory.tendsto_of_forall_isOpen_le_liminf` gives the implication (O) → (T) for
    any sequence of Borel probability measures.

We also deduce a practical convergence criterion for probability measures, in
`IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_of_tendsto_of_mem`.
Assume that, applied to all the elements of a π-system, a sequence of probability measures
converges to a limiting probability measure. Assume also that the π-system contains arbitrarily
small neighborhoods of any point. Then the sequence of probability measures converges for the
weak topology.

## Implementation notes

Many of the characterizations of weak convergence hold for finite measures and are proven in that
generality and then specialized to probability measures. Some implications hold with slightly
more general assumptions than in the usual statement of portmanteau theorem. The full portmanteau
theorem, however, is most convenient for probability measures on pseudo-emetrizable spaces with
their Borel sigma algebras.

Some specific considerations on the assumptions in the different implications:
* `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.limsup_measure_closed_le_of_tendsto`, i.e., implication (T) → (C),
  assumes that in the underlying topological space, indicator functions of closed sets have
  decreasing bounded continuous pointwise approximating sequences. The assumption is in the form
  of the type class `HasOuterApproxClosed`. Type class inference knows that for example the more
  common assumptions of metrizability or pseudo-emetrizability suffice.
* Where formulations are currently only provided for probability measures, one can obtain the
  finite measure formulations using the characterization of convergence of finite measures by
  their total masses and their probability-normalized versions, i.e., by
  `MeasureTheory.FiniteMeasure.tendsto_normalize_iff_tendsto`.

/-! ### Portmanteau: limsup condition for closed sets iff liminf condition for open sets

In this section we prove that for a sequence of Borel probability measures on a topological space
and its candidate limit measure, the following two conditions are equivalent:

  (C) For any closed set F, the limsup of the measures of F under μs is at most
      the measure of F under μ, i.e., limsupᵢ μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F);
  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μs is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfᵢ μsᵢ(G).

Either of these will later be shown to be equivalent to the weak convergence of the sequence
of measures.

/-! ### Portmanteau implication: liminf condition for open sets implies weak convergence


In this section we prove for a sequence (μsₙ)ₙ Borel probability measures that

  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μsₙ is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfₙ μsₙ(G).

implies

  (T) The measures μsₙ converge weakly to the measure μ.

/-- Consider a set of sets `S` containing arbitrarily small neighborhoods of any point, and a
probability measure. Then any open set can be approximated arbitrarily well in measure from inside
by a finite union of elements of `S`.

This is a technical lemma for `IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_of_tendsto_of_mem`, which is
why it is formulated for a `ProbabilityMeasure`. If needed, this could be generalized to finite
measures or to general measures.

  /- We apply the portmanteau theorem: it suffices to show that, given an open set `G`
  and `r < ν G`, then for large `i` one has `r < μᵢ G`. For this, we approximate `G` from inside by
  a finite union `G'` of elements of `S`, still with measure `> r`, by Lemma
  `ProbabilityMeasure.exists_lt_measure_biUnion_of_isOpen`. If we have `μᵢ G' → ν G'`,
  then we deduce `r < μᵢ G'` for large `i`, and therefore `r < μᵢ G`.

  Our assumption does not give directly `μᵢ G' → ν G'`, as `G'` does not belong to the π-system `S`.
  However, the inclusion-exclusion formula makes it possible to express `μᵢ G'` and `ν G'` in terms
  of the measures of intersections of elements of `S`, for which we have the convergence. It follows
  that `μᵢ G' → ν G'` holds, concluding the proof. This second step is already formalized in the
