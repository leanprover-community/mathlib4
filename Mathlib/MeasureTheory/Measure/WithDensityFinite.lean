# s-finite measures can be written as `withDensity` of a finite measure

If `μ` is an s-finite measure, then there exists a finite measure `μ.toFinite` and a measurable
function `densityToFinite μ` such that `μ = μ.toFinite.withDensity μ.densityToFinite`. If `μ` is
zero this is the zero measure, and otherwise we can choose a probability measure for `μ.toFinite`.

That measure is not unique, and in particular our implementation leads to `μ.toFinite ≠ μ` even if
`μ` is a probability measure.

We use this construction to define a set `μ.sigmaFiniteSet`, such that `μ.restrict μ.sigmaFiniteSet`
is sigma-finite, and for all measurable sets `s ⊆ μ.sigmaFiniteSetᶜ`, either `μ s = 0`
or `μ s = ∞`.

## Main definitions

In these definitions and the results below, `μ` is an s-finite measure (`SFinite μ`).

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.toFinite`: a finite measure with `μ ≪ μ.toFinite` and `μ.toFinite ≪ μ`.
  If `μ ≠ 0`, this is a probability measure.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.densityToFinite`: a measurable function such that
  `μ = μ.toFinite.withDensity μ.densityToFinite`.

## Main statements

* `absolutelyContinuous_toFinite`: `μ ≪ μ.toFinite`.
* `toFinite_absolutelyContinuous`: `μ.toFinite ≪ μ`.
* `withDensity_densitytoFinite`: `μ.toFinite.withDensity μ.densityToFinite = μ`.
