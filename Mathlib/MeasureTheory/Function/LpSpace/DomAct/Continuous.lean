# Continuity of the action of `Mᵈᵐᵃ` on `MeasureSpace.Lp E p μ`

In this file we prove that under certain conditions,
the action of `Mᵈᵐᵃ` on `MeasureTheory.Lp E p μ` is continuous in both variables.

Recall that `Mᵈᵐᵃ` acts on `MeasureTheory.Lp E p μ`
by `mk c • f = MeasureTheory.Lp.compMeasurePreserving (c • ·) _ f`.
This action is defined, if `M` acts on `X` by mesaure preserving maps.

If `M` acts on `X` by continuous maps
preserving a locally finite measure
which is inner regular for finite measure sets with respect to compact sets,
then the action of `Mᵈᵐᵃ` on `Lp E p μ` described above, `1 ≤ p < ∞`,
is continuous in both arguments.

In particular, it applies to the case when `X = M` is a locally compact topological group,
and `μ` is the Haar measure.
