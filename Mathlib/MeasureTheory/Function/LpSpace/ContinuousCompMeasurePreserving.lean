# Continuity of `MeasureTheory.Lp.compMeasurePreserving`

In this file we prove that the composition of an `L^p` function `g`
with a continuous measure-preserving map `f` is continuous in both arguments.

First, we prove it for indicator functions,
in terms of convergence of `μ ((f a ⁻¹' s) ∆ (g ⁻¹' s))` to zero.

Then we prove the continuity of the function of two arguments
defined on `MeasureTheory.Lp E p ν × {f : C(X, Y) // MeasurePreserving f μ ν}`.

Finally, we provide dot notation convenience lemmas.

/-- Let `X` and `Y` be R₁ topological spaces
with Borel σ-algebras and measures `μ` and `ν`, respectively.
Suppose that `μ` is inner regular for finite measure sets with respect to compact sets
and `ν` is a locally finite measure.
Let `f : α → C(X, Y)` be a family of continuous maps
that converges to a continuous map `g : C(X, Y)` in the compact-open topology along a filter `l`.
Suppose that `g` is a measure preserving map
and `f a` is a measure preserving map eventually along `l`.
Then for any finite measure measurable set `s`,
the preimages `f a ⁻¹' s` tend to the preimage `g ⁻¹' s` in measure.
More precisely, the measure of the symmetric difference of these two sets tends to zero. -/
