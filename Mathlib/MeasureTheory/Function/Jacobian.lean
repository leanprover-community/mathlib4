# Change of variables in higher-dimensional integrals

Let `μ` be a Lebesgue measure on a finite-dimensional real vector space `E`.
Let `f : E → E` be a function which is injective and differentiable on a measurable set `s`,
with derivative `f'`. Then we prove that `f '' s` is measurable, and
its measure is given by the formula `μ (f '' s) = ∫⁻ x in s, |(f' x).det| ∂μ` (where `(f' x).det`
is almost everywhere measurable, but not Borel-measurable in general). This formula is proved in
`lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image`. We deduce the change of variables
formula for the Lebesgue and Bochner integrals, in `lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_mul`
and `integral_image_eq_integral_abs_det_fderiv_smul` respectively.

Specialized versions in one dimension (using the derivative instead of the determinant of the
Fréchet derivative) can be found in the file `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/JacobianOneDim.lean`,
together with versions for monotone and antitone functions.

## Main results

* `addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn_of_addHaar_eq_zero`: if `f` is differentiable on a
  set `s` with zero measure, then `f '' s` also has zero measure.
* `addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_det_fderivWithin_eq_zero`: if `f` is differentiable on a set `s`, and
  its derivative is never invertible, then `f '' s` has zero measure (a version of Sard's lemma).
* `aemeasurable_fderivWithin`: if `f` is differentiable on a measurable set `s`, then `f'`
  is almost everywhere measurable on `s`.

For the next statements, `s` is a measurable set and `f` is differentiable on `s`
(with a derivative `f'`) and injective on `s`.

* `measurable_image_of_fderivWithin`: the image `f '' s` is measurable.
* `measurableEmbedding_of_fderivWithin`: the function `s.restrict f` is a measurable embedding.
* `lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image`: the image measure is given by
    `μ (f '' s) = ∫⁻ x in s, |(f' x).det| ∂μ`.
* `lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_mul`: for `g : E → ℝ≥0∞`, one has
    `∫⁻ x in f '' s, g x ∂μ = ∫⁻ x in s, ENNReal.ofReal |(f' x).det| * g (f x) ∂μ`.
* `integral_image_eq_integral_abs_det_fderiv_smul`: for `g : E → F`, one has
    `∫ x in f '' s, g x ∂μ = ∫ x in s, |(f' x).det| • g (f x) ∂μ`.
* `integrableOn_image_iff_integrableOn_abs_det_fderiv_smul`: for `g : E → F`, the function `g` is
  integrable on `f '' s` if and only if `|(f' x).det| • g (f x)` is integrable on `s`.

## Implementation

Typical versions of these results in the literature have much stronger assumptions: `s` would
typically be open, and the derivative `f' x` would depend continuously on `x` and be invertible
everywhere, to have the local inverse theorem at our disposal. The proof strategy under our weaker
assumptions is more involved. We follow [Fremlin, *Measure Theory* (volume 2)][fremlin_vol2].

The first remark is that, if `f` is sufficiently well approximated by a linear map `A` on a set
`s`, then `f` expands the volume of `s` by at least `A.det - ε` and at most `A.det + ε`, where
the closeness condition depends on `A` in a non-explicit way (see `addHaar_image_le_mul_of_det_lt`
and `mul_le_addHaar_image_of_lt_det`). This fact holds for balls by a simple inclusion argument,
and follows for general sets using the Besicovitch covering theorem to cover the set by balls with
measures adding up essentially to `μ s`.

When `f` is differentiable on `s`, one may partition `s` into countably many subsets `s ∩ t n`
(where `t n` is measurable), on each of which `f` is well approximated by a linear map, so that the
above results apply. See `exists_partition_approximatesLinearOn_of_hasFDerivWithinAt`, which
follows from the pointwise differentiability (in a non-completely trivial way, as one should ensure
a form of uniformity on the sets of the partition).

Combining the above two results would give the conclusion, except for two difficulties: it is not
obvious why `f '' s` and `f'` should be measurable, which prevents us from using countable
additivity for the measure and the integral. It turns out that `f '' s` is indeed measurable,
and that `f'` is almost everywhere measurable, which is enough to recover countable additivity.

The measurability of `f '' s` follows from the deep Lusin-Souslin theorem ensuring that, in a
Polish space, a continuous injective image of a measurable set is measurable.

The key point to check the almost everywhere measurability of `f'` is that, if `f` is approximated
up to `δ` by a linear map on a set `s`, then `f'` is within `δ` of `A` on a full measure subset
of `s` (namely, its density points). With the above approximation argument, it follows that `f'`
is the almost everywhere limit of a sequence of measurable functions (which are constant on the
pieces of the good discretization), and is therefore almost everywhere measurable.

### Decomposition lemmas

We state lemmas ensuring that a differentiable function can be approximated, on countably many
measurable pieces, by linear maps (with a prescribed precision depending on the linear map).

  /- Choose countably many linear maps `f' z`. For every such map, if `f` has a derivative at `x`
    close enough to `f' z`, then `f y - f x` is well approximated by `f' z (y - x)` for `y` close
    enough to `x`, say on a ball of radius `r` (or even `u n` for some `n`, where `u` is a fixed
    sequence tending to `0`).
    Let `M n z` be the points where this happens. Then this set is relatively closed inside `s`,
    and moreover in every closed ball of radius `u n / 3` inside it the map is well approximated by
    `f' z`. Using countably many closed balls to split `M n z` into small diameter subsets
    `K n z p`, one obtains the desired sets `t q` after reindexing.

### Measure zero of the image, over non-measurable sets

If a set has measure `0`, then its image under a differentiable map has measure zero. This doesn't
require the set to be measurable. In the same way, if `f` is differentiable on a set `s` with
non-invertible derivative everywhere, then `f '' s` has measure `0`, again without measurability
assumptions.

### Weak measurability statements

We show that the derivative of a function on a set is almost everywhere measurable, and that the
image `f '' s` is measurable if `f` is injective on `s`. The latter statement follows from the
Lusin-Souslin theorem.

/-- The derivative of a function on a measurable set is almost everywhere measurable on this set
with respect to Lebesgue measure. Note that, in general, it is not genuinely measurable there,
as `f'` is not unique (but only on a set of measure `0`, as the argument shows). -/

### Proving the estimate for the measure of the image

We show the formula `∫⁻ x in s, ENNReal.ofReal |(f' x).det| ∂μ = μ (f '' s)`,
in `lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image`. For this, we show both inequalities in both
directions, first up to controlled errors and then letting these errors tend to `0`.
