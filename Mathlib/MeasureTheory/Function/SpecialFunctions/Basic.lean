# Measurability of real and complex functions

We show that most standard real and complex functions are measurable, notably `exp`, `cos`, `sin`,
`cosh`, `sinh`, `log`, `pow`, `arcsin`, `arccos`.

See also `MeasureTheory.Function.SpecialFunctions.Arctan` and
`MeasureTheory.Function.SpecialFunctions.Inner`, which have been split off to minimize imports.
