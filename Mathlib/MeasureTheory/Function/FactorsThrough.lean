# Factorization of a map from measurability

Consider `f : X → Y` and `g : X → Z` and assume that `g` is measurable with respect to the pullback
along `f`. Then `g` factors though `f`, which means that there exists `h : Y → Z` such that
`g = h ∘ f`.

## TODO

* Under certain assumptions, the factorization map `h` is measurable. This is the content of the
  [Doob-Dynkin lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doob–Dynkin_lemma).
