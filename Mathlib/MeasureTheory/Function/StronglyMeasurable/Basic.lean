# Strongly measurable and finitely strongly measurable functions

A function `f` is said to be strongly measurable if `f` is the sequential limit of simple functions.
It is said to be finitely strongly measurable with respect to a measure `μ` if the supports
of those simple functions have finite measure.

If the target space has a second countable topology, strongly measurable and measurable are
equivalent.

If the measure is sigma-finite, strongly measurable and finitely strongly measurable are equivalent.

The main property of finitely strongly measurable functions is
`FinStronglyMeasurable.exists_set_sigmaFinite`: there exists a measurable set `t` such that the
function is supported on `t` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite. As a consequence, we can prove some
results for those functions as if the measure was sigma-finite.

We provide a solid API for strongly measurable functions, as a basis for the Bochner integral.

## Main definitions

* `StronglyMeasurable f`: `f : α → β` is the limit of a sequence `fs : ℕ → SimpleFunc α β`.
* `FinStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f : α → β` is the limit of a sequence `fs : ℕ → SimpleFunc α β`
  such that for all `n ∈ ℕ`, the measure of the support of `fs n` is finite.
