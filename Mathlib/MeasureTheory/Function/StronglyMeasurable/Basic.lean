# Strongly measurable and finitely strongly measurable functions

A function `f` is said to be strongly measurable if `f` is the sequential limit of simple functions.
It is said to be finitely strongly measurable with respect to a measure `μ` if the supports
of those simple functions have finite measure. We also provide almost everywhere versions of
these notions.

Almost everywhere strongly measurable functions form the largest class of functions that can be
integrated using the Bochner integral.

If the target space has a second countable topology, strongly measurable and measurable are
equivalent.

If the measure is sigma-finite, strongly measurable and finitely strongly measurable are equivalent.

The main property of finitely strongly measurable functions is
`FinStronglyMeasurable.exists_set_sigmaFinite`: there exists a measurable set `t` such that the
function is supported on `t` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite. As a consequence, we can prove some
results for those functions as if the measure was sigma-finite.

## Main definitions

* `StronglyMeasurable f`: `f : α → β` is the limit of a sequence `fs : ℕ → SimpleFunc α β`.
* `FinStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f : α → β` is the limit of a sequence `fs : ℕ → SimpleFunc α β`
  such that for all `n ∈ ℕ`, the measure of the support of `fs n` is finite.
* `AEStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f` is almost everywhere equal to a `StronglyMeasurable` function.
* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f` is almost everywhere equal to a `FinStronglyMeasurable`
  function.

* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable.sigmaFiniteSet`: a measurable set `t` such that
  `f =ᵐ[μ.restrict tᶜ] 0` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite.

## Main statements

* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable.exists_set_sigmaFinite`: there exists a measurable set `t` such that
  `f =ᵐ[μ.restrict tᶜ] 0` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite.

We provide a solid API for strongly measurable functions, and for almost everywhere strongly
measurable functions, as a basis for the Bochner integral.
