# Strongly measurable and finitely strongly measurable functions

A function `f` is said to be almost everywhere strongly measurable if `f` is almost everywhere
equal to a strongly measurable function, i.e. the sequential limit of simple functions.
It is said to be almost everywhere finitely strongly measurable with respect to a measure `μ`
if the supports of those simple functions have finite measure.

Almost everywhere strongly measurable functions form the largest class of functions that can be
integrated using the Bochner integral.

## Main definitions
* `AEStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f` is almost everywhere equal to a `StronglyMeasurable` function.
* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable f μ`: `f` is almost everywhere equal to a `FinStronglyMeasurable`
  function.

* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable.sigmaFiniteSet`: a measurable set `t` such that
  `f =ᵐ[μ.restrict tᶜ] 0` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite.

## Main statements

* `AEFinStronglyMeasurable.exists_set_sigmaFinite`: there exists a measurable set `t` such that
  `f =ᵐ[μ.restrict tᶜ] 0` and `μ.restrict t` is sigma-finite.

We provide a solid API for almost everywhere strongly
measurable functions, as a basis for the Bochner integral.
