# Borel-Cantelli lemma, part 1

In this file we show one implication of the **Borel-Cantelli lemma**:
if `s i` is a countable family of sets such that `∑' i, μ (s i)` is finite,
then a.e. all points belong to finitely many sets of the family.

We prove several versions of this lemma:

- `MeasureTheory.ae_finite_setOf_mem`: as stated above;
- `MeasureTheory.measure_limsup_cofinite_eq_zero`:
  in terms of `Filter.limsup` along `Filter.cofinite`;
- `MeasureTheory.measure_limsup_atTop_eq_zero`:
  in terms of `Filter.limsup` along `(Filter.atTop : Filter ℕ)`.

For the *second* Borel-Cantelli lemma (applying to independent sets in a probability space),
see `ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one`.
