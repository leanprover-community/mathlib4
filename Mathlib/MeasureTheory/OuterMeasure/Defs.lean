# Definitions of an outer measure and the corresponding `FunLike` class

In this file we define `MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure α`
to be the type of outer measures on `α`.

An outer measure is a function `μ : Set α → ℝ≥0∞`,
from the powerset of a type to the extended nonnegative real numbers
that satisfies the following conditions:
1. `μ ∅ = 0`;
2. `μ` is monotone;
3. `μ` is countably subadditive. This means that the outer measure of a countable union
   is at most the sum of the outer measure on the individual sets.

Note that we do not need `α` to be measurable to define an outer measure.

We also define a typeclass `MeasureTheory.OuterMeasureClass`.
