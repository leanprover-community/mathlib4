# Uniformly locally doubling measures and Lebesgue's density theorem

Lebesgue's density theorem states that given a set `S` in a sigma compact metric space with
locally-finite uniformly locally doubling measure `μ` then for almost all points `x` in `S`, for any
sequence of closed balls `B₀, B₁, B₂, ...` containing `x`, the limit `μ (S ∩ Bⱼ) / μ (Bⱼ) → 1` as
`j → ∞`.

In this file we combine general results about existence of Vitali families for uniformly locally
doubling measures with results about differentiation along a Vitali family to obtain an explicit
form of Lebesgue's density theorem.

## Main results
  * `is_unif_loc_doubling_measure.ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div`: a version of Lebesgue's density
  theorem for sequences of balls converging on a point but whose centres are not required to be
  fixed.
