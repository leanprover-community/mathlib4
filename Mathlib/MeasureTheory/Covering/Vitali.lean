# Vitali covering theorems

The topological Vitali covering theorem, in its most classical version, states the following.
Consider a family of balls `(B (x_i, r_i))_{i ∈ I}` in a metric space, with uniformly bounded
radii. Then one can extract a disjoint subfamily indexed by `J ⊆ I`, such that any `B (x_i, r_i)`
is included in a ball `B (x_j, 5 r_j)`.

We prove this theorem in `Vitali.exists_disjoint_subfamily_covering_enlargment_closedBall`.
It is deduced from a more general version, called
`Vitali.exists_disjoint_subfamily_covering_enlargment`, which applies to any family of sets
together with a size function `δ` (think "radius" or "diameter").

We deduce the measurable Vitali covering theorem. Assume one is given a family `t` of closed sets
with nonempty interior, such that each `a ∈ t` is included in a ball `B (x, r)` and covers a
definite proportion of the ball `B (x, 6 r)` for a given measure `μ` (think of the situation
where `μ` is a doubling measure and `t` is a family of balls). Consider a set `s` at which the
family is fine, i.e., every point of `s` belongs to arbitrarily small elements of `t`. Then one
can extract from `t` a disjoint subfamily that covers almost all `s`. It is proved in
`Vitali.exists_disjoint_covering_ae`.

A way to restate this theorem is to say that the set of closed sets `a` with nonempty interior
covering a fixed proportion `1/C` of the ball `closedBall x (3 * diam a)` forms a Vitali family.
This version is given in `Vitali.vitaliFamily`.

/-- **Vitali covering theorem**: given a set `t` of subsets of a type, one may extract a disjoint
subfamily `u` such that the `τ`-enlargment of this family covers all elements of `t`, where `τ > 1`
is any fixed number.

When `t` is a family of balls, the `τ`-enlargment of `ball x r` is `ball x ((1+2τ) r)`. In general,
it is expressed in terms of a function `δ` (think "radius" or "diameter"), positive and bounded on
all elements of `t`. The condition is that every element `a` of `t` should intersect an
element `b` of `u` of size larger than that of `a` up to `τ`, i.e., `δ b ≥ δ a / τ`.

We state the lemma slightly more generally, with an indexed family of sets `B a` for `a ∈ t`, for
wider applicability.

    ∃ u ⊆ t,
      u.PairwiseDisjoint B ∧ ∀ a ∈ t, ∃ b ∈ u, (B a ∩ B b).Nonempty ∧ δ a ≤ τ * δ b := by
  /- The proof could be formulated as a transfinite induction. First pick an element of `t` with `δ`
  as large as possible (up to a factor of `τ`). Then among the remaining elements not intersecting
  the already chosen one, pick another element with large `δ`. Go on forever (transfinitely) until
  there is nothing left.

  Instead, we give a direct Zorn-based argument. Consider a maximal family `u` of disjoint sets
  with the following property: if an element `a` of `t` intersects some element `b` of `u`, then it
  intersects some `b' ∈ u` with `δ b' ≥ δ a / τ`. Such a maximal family exists by Zorn. If this
  family did not intersect some element `a ∈ t`, then take an element `a' ∈ t` which does not
  intersect any element of `u`, with `δ a'` almost as large as possible. One checks easily
  that `u ∪ {a'}` still has this property, contradicting the maximality. Therefore, `u`
  intersects all elements of `t`, and by definition it satisfies all the desired properties.

/-- The measurable Vitali covering theorem. Assume one is given a family `t` of closed sets with
nonempty interior, such that each `a ∈ t` is included in a ball `B (x, r)` and covers a definite
proportion of the ball `B (x, 3 r)` for a given measure `μ` (think of the situation where `μ` is
a doubling measure and `t` is a family of balls). Consider a (possibly non-measurable) set `s`
at which the family is fine, i.e., every point of `s` belongs to arbitrarily small elements of `t`.
Then one can extract from `t` a disjoint subfamily that covers almost all `s`.

For more flexibility, we give a statement with a parameterized family of sets.

  /- The idea of the proof is the following. Assume for simplicity that `μ` is finite. Applying the
  abstract Vitali covering theorem with `δ = r` given by `hf`, one obtains a disjoint subfamily `u`,
  such that any element of `t` intersects an element of `u` with comparable radius. Fix `ε > 0`.
  Since the elements of `u` have summable measure, one can remove finitely elements `w_1, ..., w_n`.
  so that the measure of the remaining elements is `< ε`. Consider now a point `z` not
  in the `w_i`. There is a small ball around `z` not intersecting the `w_i` (as they are closed),
  an element `a ∈ t` contained in this small ball (as the family `t` is fine at `z`) and an element
  `b ∈ u` intersecting `a`, with comparable radius (by definition of `u`). Then `z` belongs to the
  enlargement of `b`. This shows that `s \ (w_1 ∪ ... ∪ w_n)` is contained in
  `⋃ (b ∈ u \ {w_1, ... w_n}) (enlargement of b)`. The measure of the latter set is bounded by
  `∑ (b ∈ u \ {w_1, ... w_n}) C * μ b` (by the doubling property of the measure), which is at most
  `C ε`. Letting `ε` tend to `0` shows that `s` is almost everywhere covered by the family `u`.

  For the real argument, the measure is only locally finite. Therefore, we implement the same
  strategy, but locally restricted to balls on which the measure is finite. For this, we do not
  use the whole family `t`, but a subfamily `t'` supported on small balls (which is possible since
  the family is assumed to be fine at every point of `s`).

/-- Assume that around every point there are arbitrarily small scales at which the measure is
doubling. Then the set of closed sets `a` with nonempty interior contained in `closedBall x r` and
covering a fixed proportion `1/C` of the ball `closedBall x (3 * r)` forms a Vitali family.
This is essentially a restatement of the measurable Vitali theorem. -/
