# Differentiation of measures

On a second countable metric space with a measure `μ`, consider a Vitali family (i.e., for each `x`
one has a family of sets shrinking to `x`, with a good behavior with respect to covering theorems).
Consider also another measure `ρ`. Then, for almost every `x`, the ratio `ρ a / μ a` converges when
`a` shrinks to `x` along the Vitali family, towards the Radon-Nikodym derivative of `ρ` with
respect to `μ`. This is the main theorem on differentiation of measures.

This theorem is proved in this file, under the name `VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_rnDeriv`. Note that,
almost surely, `μ a` is eventually positive and finite (see
`VitaliFamily.ae_eventually_measure_pos` and `VitaliFamily.eventually_measure_lt_top`), so the
ratio really makes sense.

For concrete applications, one needs concrete instances of Vitali families, as provided for instance
by `Besicovitch.vitaliFamily` (for balls) or by `Vitali.vitaliFamily` (for doubling measures).

Specific applications to Lebesgue density points and the Lebesgue differentiation theorem are also
derived:
* `VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div` states that, for almost every point `x ∈ s`,
  then `μ (s ∩ a) / μ a` tends to `1` as `a` shrinks to `x` along a Vitali family.
* `VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_average_norm_sub` states that, for almost every point `x`, then the
  average of `y ↦ ‖f y - f x‖` on `a` tends to `0` as `a` shrinks to `x` along a Vitali family.

## Sketch of proof

Let `v` be a Vitali family for `μ`. Assume for simplicity that `ρ` is absolutely continuous with
respect to `μ`, as the case of a singular measure is easier.

It is easy to see that a set `s` on which `liminf ρ a / μ a < q` satisfies `ρ s ≤ q * μ s`, by using
a disjoint subcovering provided by the definition of Vitali families. Similarly for the limsup.
It follows that a set on which `ρ a / μ a` oscillates has measure `0`, and therefore that
`ρ a / μ a` converges almost surely (`VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_div`). Moreover, on a set where the
limit is close to a constant `c`, one gets `ρ s ∼ c μ s`, using again a covering lemma as above.
It follows that `ρ` is equal to `μ.withDensity (v.limRatio ρ x)`, where `v.limRatio ρ x` is the
limit of `ρ a / μ a` at `x` (which is well defined almost everywhere). By uniqueness of the
Radon-Nikodym derivative, one gets `v.limRatio ρ x = ρ.rnDeriv μ x` almost everywhere, completing
the proof.

There is a difficulty in this sketch: this argument works well when `v.limRatio ρ` is measurable,
but there is no guarantee that this is the case, especially if one doesn't make further assumptions
on the Vitali family. We use an indirect argument to show that `v.limRatio ρ` is always
almost everywhere measurable, again based on the disjoint subcovering argument
(see `VitaliFamily.exists_measurable_supersets_limRatio`), and then proceed as sketched above
but replacing `v.limRatio ρ` by a measurable version called `v.limRatioMeas ρ`.

## Counterexample

The standing assumption in this file is that spaces are second countable. Without this assumption,
measures may be zero locally but nonzero globally, which is not compatible with differentiation
theory (which deduces global information from local one). Here is an example displaying this
behavior.

Define a measure `μ` by `μ s = 0` if `s` is covered by countably many balls of radius `1`,
and `μ s = ∞` otherwise. This is indeed a countably additive measure, which is moreover
locally finite and doubling at small scales. It vanishes on every ball of radius `1`, so all the
quantities in differentiation theory (defined as ratios of measures as the radius tends to zero)
make no sense. However, the measure is not globally zero if the space is big enough.

  /- Here is a rough sketch, assuming that the measure is finite and the limit is well defined
    everywhere. Let `u := {x | v.limRatio ρ x < p}` and `w := {x | q < v.limRatio ρ x}`. They
    have measurable supersets `u'` and `w'` of the same measure. We will show that these satisfy
    the conclusion of the theorem, i.e., `μ (u' ∩ w') = 0`. For this, note that
    `ρ (u' ∩ w') = ρ (u ∩ w')` (as `w'` is measurable, see `measure_toMeasurable_add_inter_left`).
    The latter set is included in the set where the limit of the ratios is `< p`, and therefore
    its measure is `≤ p * μ (u ∩ w')`. Using the same trick in the other direction gives that this
    is `p * μ (u' ∩ w')`. We have shown that `ρ (u' ∩ w') ≤ p * μ (u' ∩ w')`. Arguing in the same
    way but using the `w` part gives `q * μ (u' ∩ w') ≤ ρ (u' ∩ w')`. If `μ (u' ∩ w')` were nonzero,
    this would be a contradiction as `p < q`.

    For the rigorous proof, we need to work on a part of the space where the measure is finite
    (provided by `spanningSets (ρ + μ)`) and to restrict to the set where the limit is well defined
    (called `s` below, of full measure). Otherwise, the argument goes through.

/-- Weak version of the main theorem on differentiation of measures: given a Vitali family `v`
for a locally finite measure `μ`, and another locally finite measure `ρ`, then for `μ`-almost
every `x` the ratio `ρ a / μ a` converges, when `a` shrinks to `x` along the Vitali family,
towards the Radon-Nikodym derivative of `ρ` with respect to `μ`.

This version assumes that `ρ` is absolutely continuous with respect to `μ`. The general version

/-- Given a measurable set `s`, then `μ (s ∩ a) / μ a` converges when `a` shrinks to a typical
point `x` along a Vitali family. The limit is `1` for `x ∈ s` and `0` for `x ∉ s`. This shows that
almost every point of `s` is a Lebesgue density point for `s`. A version for non-measurable sets
holds, but it only gives the first conclusion, see `ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div`. -/

    We apply this to a countable set of `c` which is dense in the range of `f`, to deduce the
    desired convergence.
    A minor technical inconvenience is that constants are not integrable, so to apply previous
    lemmas we need to replace `c` with the restriction of `c` to a finite measure set `A n` in the
