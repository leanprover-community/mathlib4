# The category of measurable spaces

Measurable spaces and measurable functions form a (concrete) category `Meas`.

## Main definitions

* `Measure : Meas ⥤ Meas`: the functor which sends a measurable space `X`
to the space of measures on `X`; it is a monad (the "Giry monad").

* `Borel : Top ⥤ Meas`: sends a topological space `X` to `X` equipped with the
`σ`-algebra of Borel sets (the `σ`-algebra generated by the open subsets of `X`).

/-- `Measure X` is the measurable space of measures over the measurable space `X`. It is the
weakest measurable space, s.t. λμ, μ s is measurable for all measurable sets `s` in `X`. An
important purpose is to assign a monadic structure on it, the Giry monad. In the Giry monad,
the pure values are the Dirac measure, and the bind operation maps to the integral:
`(μ >>= ν) s = ∫ x. (ν x) s dμ`.

In probability theory, the `Meas`-morphisms `X → Prob X` are (sub-)Markov kernels (here `Prob` is
the restriction of `Measure` to (sub-)probability space.)
