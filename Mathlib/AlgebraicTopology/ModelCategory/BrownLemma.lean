# The factorization lemma by K. S. Brown

In a model category, any morphism `f : X ‚ü∂ Y` between
cofibrant objects can be factored as `i ‚â´ p`
with `i` a cofibration and `p` a trivial fibration
which has a section `s` that is a cofibration.
In order to state this, we introduce a structure
`CofibrantBrownFactorization f` with the data
of such morphisms `i`, `p` and `s` with the expected
properties, and show it is nonempty.
Moreover, if `f` is a weak equivalence, then all the
morphisms `i`, `p` and `s` are weak equivalences.
(We also obtain the dual results about morphisms
between fibrant objects.)
