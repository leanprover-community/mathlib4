# Categories with classes of fibrations, cofibrations, weak equivalences

We introduce typeclasses `CategoryWithFibrations`, `CategoryWithCofibrations` and
`CategoryWithWeakEquivalences` to express that a category `C` is equipped with
classes of morphisms named "fibrations", "cofibrations" or "weak equivalences".
