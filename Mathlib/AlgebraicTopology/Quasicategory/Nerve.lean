# The nerve of a category is a quasicategory

In `AlgebraicTopology.Quasicategory.StrictSegal`, we show that any
strict Segal simplicial set is a quasicategory.
In `AlgebraicTopology.SimplicialSet.StrictSegal`, we show that the nerve of a
category satisfies the strict Segal condition.

In this file, we prove as a direct consequence that the nerve of a category is
a quasicategory.
