# Simplicial categories

A simplicial category is a category `C` that is enriched over the
category of simplicial sets in such a way that morphisms in
`C` identify to the `0`-simplices of the enriched hom.

## TODO

* construct a simplicial category structure on simplicial objects, so
that it applies in particular to simplicial sets
* obtain the adjunction property `(K ⊗ X ⟶ Y) ≃ (K ⟶ sHom X Y)` when `K`, `X`, and `Y`
are simplicial sets
* develop the notion of "simplicial tensor" `K ⊗ₛ X : C` with `K : SSet` and `X : C`
an object in a simplicial category `C`
* define the notion of path between `0`-simplices of simplicial sets
* deduce the notion of homotopy between morphisms in a simplicial category
* obtain that homotopies in simplicial categories can be interpreted as given
by morphisms `Δ[1] ⊗ X ⟶ Y`.
