# Cofibrations and fibrations in the category of simplicial sets

We endow `SSet` with `CategoryWithCofibrations` and `CategoryWithFibrations`
instances. Cofibrations are monomorphisms, and fibrations are morphisms
having the right lifting property with respect to horn inclusions.

We have an instance `mono_of_cofibration` (but only a lemma `cofibration_of_mono`).
Then, when stating lemmas about cofibrations of simplicial sets, it is advisable
to use the assumption `[Mono f]` instead of `[Cofibration f]`.
