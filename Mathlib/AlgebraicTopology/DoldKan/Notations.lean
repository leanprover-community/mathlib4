# Notations for the Dold-Kan equivalence

This file defines the notation `K[X] : ChainComplex C ℕ` for the alternating face
map complex of `(X : SimplicialObject C)` where `C` is a preadditive category, as well
as `N[X]` for the normalized subcomplex in the case `C` is an abelian category.

(See `Equivalence.lean` for the general strategy of proof of the Dold-Kan equivalence.)
