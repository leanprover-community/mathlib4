/-! # The Eisenstein criterion

`Polynomial.generalizedEisenstein` :
  Let `R` be an integral domain
  and let `K` an `R`-algebra which is a field
  Let `q : R[X]` be a monic polynomial which is prime in `K[X]`.
  Let `f : R[X]` be a polynomial of strictly positive degree
  satisfying the following properties:
  * the image of `f` in `K[X]` is a power of `q`.
  * the leading coefficient of `f` is not zero in `K`
  * the polynomial `f` is primitive.
  Assume moreover that `f.modByMonic q` is not zero in `(R ⧸ (P ^ 2))[X]`,
  where `P` is the kernel of `algebraMap R K`.
  Then `f` is irreducible.

We give in `Archive.Examples.Eisenstein` an explicit example
of application of this criterion.

* `Polynomial.irreducible_of_eisenstein_criterion` : the classic Eisenstein criterion.
  It is the particular case where `q := X`.

# TODO

The case of a polynomial `q := X - a` is interesting,
then the mod `P ^ 2` hypothesis can rephrased as saying
that `f.derivative.eval a ∉ P ^ 2`. (TODO)
The case of cyclotomic polynomials of prime index `p`
could be proved directly using that result, taking `a = 1`.

The result can also be generalized to the case where
the leading coefficients of `f` and `q` do not belong to `P`.
(By localization at `P`, make these coefficients invertible.)
There are two obstructions, though :

* Usually, one will only obtain irreducibility in `F[X]`, where `F` is the field
  of fractions of `R`. (If `R` is a UFD, this will be close to what is wanted,
  but not in general.)

* The mod `P ^ 2` hypothesis will have to be rephrased to a condition
  in the second symbolic power of `P`. When `P` is a maximal ideal,
  that symbolic power coincides with `P ^ 2`, but not in general.

/-- A generalized Eisenstein criterion

Let `R` be an integral domain and `K` an `R`-algebra which is a domain.
Let `q : R[X]` be a monic polynomial which is prime in `K[X]`.
Let `f : R[X]` be a primitive polynomial of strictly positive degree
whose leading coefficient is not zero in `K`
and such that the image `f` in `K[X]` is a power of `q`.
Assume moreover that `f.modByMonic q` is not zero in `(R ⧸ (P ^ 2))[X]`,
where `P` is the kernel of `algebraMap R K`.
Then `f` is irreducible. -/
