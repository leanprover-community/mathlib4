# Flat modules

A module `M` over a commutative ring `R` is *flat*
if for all finitely generated ideals `I` of `R`,
the canonical map `I ⊗ M →ₗ M` is injective.

This is equivalent to the claim that for all injective `R`-linear maps `f : M₁ → M₂`
the induced map `M₁ ⊗ M → M₂ ⊗ M` is injective.
See <https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00HD>.
This result is not yet formalised.

## Main declaration

* `Module.Flat`: the predicate asserting that an `R`-module `M` is flat.

## TODO

* Show that tensoring with a flat module preserves injective morphisms.
  Show that this is equivalent to be flat.
  See <https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00HD>.
  To do this, it is probably a good idea to think about a suitable
  categorical induction principle that should be applied to the category of `R`-modules,
  and that will take care of the administrative side of the proof.
* Define flat `R`-algebras
* Define flat ring homomorphisms
  - Show that the identity is flat
  - Show that composition of flat morphisms is flat
* Show that flatness is stable under base change (aka extension of scalars)
  For base change, it will be very useful to have a "characteristic predicate"
  instead of relying on the construction `A ⊗ B`.
  Indeed, such a predicate should allow us to treat both
  `A[X]` and `A ⊗ R[X]` as the base change of `R[X]` to `A`.
  (Similar examples exist with `Fin n → R`, `R × R`, `ℤ[i] ⊗ ℝ`, etc...)
* Generalize flatness to noncommutative rings.
