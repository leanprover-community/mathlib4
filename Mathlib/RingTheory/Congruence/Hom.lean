# Congruence relations and homomorphisms

This file contains elementary definitions involving congruence relations and ring morphisms.

## Main definitions

 * `RingCon.ker`: the kernel of a ring homomorphism as a congruence relation
 * `RingCon.mk'`: the map from a ring to its quotient by a congruence relation
 * `RingCon.lift`: the homomorphism on the quotient given that the congruence is in the kernel
 * `RingCon.map`: homomorphism from a smaller to a larger quotient

## TODO

Repeat everything in this file for `NonUnitalRingHom`.
