# Prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring as a type

The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring is the type of all prime ideals.

For the Zariski topology, see `Mathlib/RingTheory/Spectrum/Prime/Topology.lean`.

(It is also naturally endowed with a sheaf of rings,
which is constructed in `AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf`.)

## Main definitions

* `PrimeSpectrum R`: The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring `R`,
  i.e., the set of all prime ideals of `R`.

/-- The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring `R` is the type of all prime ideals of `R`.

It is naturally endowed with a topology (the Zariski topology),
and a sheaf of commutative rings (see `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf.lean`).
It is a fundamental building block in algebraic geometry. -/

## The specialization order

We endow `PrimeSpectrum R` with a partial order induced from the ideal lattice.
This is exactly the specialization order.
See the corresponding section at `Mathlib/RingTheory/Spectrum/Prime/Topology.lean`.
