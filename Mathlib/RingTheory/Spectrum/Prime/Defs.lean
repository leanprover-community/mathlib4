# Prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring as a type

The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring is the type of all prime ideals.

For the Zariski topology, see `Mathlib.RingTheory.Spectrum.Prime.Topology`.

(It is also naturally endowed with a sheaf of rings,
which is constructed in `AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf`.)

## Main definitions

* `PrimeSpectrum R`: The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring `R`,
  i.e., the set of all prime ideals of `R`.

/-- The prime spectrum of a commutative (semi)ring `R` is the type of all prime ideals of `R`.

It is naturally endowed with a topology (the Zariski topology),
and a sheaf of commutative rings (see `Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf`).
It is a fundamental building block in algebraic geometry. -/
