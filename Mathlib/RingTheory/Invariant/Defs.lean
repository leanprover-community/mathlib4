# Invariant Extensions of Rings

Given an extension of rings `B/A` and an action of `G` on `B`, we introduce a predicate
`Algebra.IsInvariant A B G` which states that every fixed point of `B` lies in the image of `A`.

The main application is in algebraic number theory, where `G := Gal(L/K)` is the galois group
of some finite galois extension of number fields, and `A := 𝓞K` and `B := 𝓞L` are their rings of
integers.

/-- An action of a group `G` on an extension of rings `B/A` is invariant if every fixed point of
`B` lies in the image of `A`. The converse statement that every point in the image of `A` is fixed
by `G` is `smul_algebraMap` (assuming `SMulCommClass A B G`). -/
