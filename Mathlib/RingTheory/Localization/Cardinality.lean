# Cardinality of localizations

In this file, we establish the cardinality of localizations. In most cases, a localization has
cardinality equal to the base ring. If there are zero-divisors, however, this is no longer true -
for example, `ZMod 6` localized at `{2, 4}` is equal to `ZMod 3`, and if you have zero in your
submonoid, then your localization is trivial (see `IsLocalization.uniqueOfZeroMem`).

## Main statements

* `IsLocalization.cardinalMk_le`: A localization has cardinality no larger than the base ring.
* `IsLocalization.cardinalMk`: If you don't localize at zero-divisors, the localization of a ring
  has cardinality equal to its base ring.
