# `IsReduced` is a local property

In this file, we prove that `IsReduced` is a local property.

## Main results

Let `R` be a commutative ring, `M` be a submonoid of `R`.

* `isReduced_localizationPreserves` :  `M⁻¹R` is reduced if `R` is reduced.
* `isReduced_ofLocalizationMaximal` : `R` is reduced if `Rₘ` is reduced for all maximal ideal `m`.
