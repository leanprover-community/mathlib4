# `IsIntegrallyClosed` is a local property

In this file, we prove that `IsIntegrallyClosed` is a local property.

## Main results

* `IsIntegrallyClosed.of_localization_maximal` : An integral domain `R` is integral closed
  if `Rₘ` is integral closed for any maximal ideal `m` of `R`.

## TODO

Prove that `IsIntegrallyClosed` is preserved by localization
