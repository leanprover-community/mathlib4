This file defines a type class assumption `AddSubmonoidSSup σ M`, which asserts that the `sSup` in
some `SetLike` structure `σ` of `AddSubmonoid`s of some `AddCommMonoid` `M` is just the `sSup` of
submonoids (i.e. the span/additive closure of the union.)

Given `{σ M : Type*} [SetLike σ M]`, we have a map

  `coe : σ → Set M`

Given, in addition `[AddCommMonoid M] [AddSubmonoidClass σ M]`, this map factors through
`AddSubmonoid M`, so we have

  `σ → AddSubmonoid M → Set M`

(The first map in this factorization is called `AddSubmonoid.ofClass`, while the second is really a
special case of `coe`.)

Given, in addition `[CompleteLattice σ]`, we can make various assumptions about the behaviour of
these maps with respect to the complete lattice structures on each of `σ`, `AddSubmonoid M`, `Set
M`.

- Mathlib's `[IsConcreteLE σ M]` asserts that `coe` is order-preserving and also order-reflecting.
  (In functor language, `coe` *is* a functor, automatically faithful, and also full.)
- The map `AddSubmonoid M → Set M` (a special case of `coe`) has the property `IsConcreteLE`. It
  moreover preserves arbitrary meets/infimas/limits = intersections, but not joins/supremas/
  colimits. (In functor  language, it is a full and faithful functor that preserves limits. It is
  right adjoint to `AddSubmonoid.closure`.  Together, these functors define a  "GaloisInsertion",
  i.e. a Galois adjunction such that `closure ∘ coe = id`.)
- The assumption `[AddSubmonoidSSup σ M]` defined here asserts that the factorization
  `ofClass : σ → AddSubmonoid M` preserves joins/supremas/colimits.
  This implies that the map is order-preserving, but we do not need this.
  It also implies that there is a right adjoint, but again, we do not need this.
  Perhaps there should be an additional typeclass for  "order-preserving" anyway, which
  `AddSubmonoidSSup` extends.
- Could perhaps put even stronger assumptions on the factorization `ofClass : σ → AddSubmonoid M`.
   hink about the case `σ = Submodules R M`.  Here, the map `ofClass : σ → AddSubmonoid M` is
  - order preserving, and
  - preserves limits, and
  - preserves colimits.
  Its left adjoint sends a submonoid `A` to the smallest R-submodule containing `A`,
  its right adjoint sends a submonoid `A` the largest R-submodule contained in `A`.
  (There is always some  such R-submodule; in the worst case, it's the submodule {0}.)
  Precomposing either of these with `ofClass` is the identity on `σ`, so these two Galois
  adjunctions are a Galois insertion and a Galois coinsertion, respectively.
