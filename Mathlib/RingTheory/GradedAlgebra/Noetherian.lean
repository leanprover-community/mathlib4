# The properties of a graded Noetherian ring.

This file proves some properties of a graded Noetherian ring:
1. The 0-th grade of a Noetherian ring is also a Noetherian ring.
2. For a Noetherian ring `A` which is internally graded by `𝒜`,
   `⨁_{i>0} 𝒜ᵢ` is finitely generated as an ideal of `A`.

If the internally graded ring `A` is Noetherian, then `𝒜 0` is a Noetherian ring.
