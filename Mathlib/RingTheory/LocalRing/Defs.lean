# Local rings

Define local rings as commutative rings having a unique maximal ideal.

## Main definitions

* `LocalRing`: A predicate on commutative semirings, stating that for any pair of elements that
  adds up to `1`, one of them is a unit. This is shown to be equivalent to the condition that there
  exists a unique maximal ideal.
* `LocalRing.maximalIdeal`: The unique maximal ideal for a local rings. Its carrier set is the
  set of non units.

/-- A semiring is local if it is nontrivial and `a` or `b` is a unit whenever `a + b = 1`.
Note that `LocalRing` is a predicate. -/
