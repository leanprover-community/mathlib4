# Local rings

Define local rings as commutative rings having a unique maximal ideal.

## Main definitions

* `IsLocalRing`: A predicate on semirings, stating that for any pair of elements that
  adds up to `1`, one of them is a unit. In the commutative case this is shown to be equivalent
  to the condition that there exists a unique maximal ideal, see
  `IsLocalRing.of_unique_max_ideal` and `IsLocalRing.maximal_ideal_unique`.

-/
/-- A semiring is local if it is nontrivial and `a` or `b` is a unit whenever `a + b = 1`.
Note that `IsLocalRing` is a predicate. -/
class IsLocalRing (R : Type*) [Semiring R] extends Nontrivial R : Prop where
  of_is_unit_or_is_unit_of_add_one ::
  /-- in a local ring `R`, if `a + b = 1`, then either `a` is a unit or `b` is a unit. In another
    word, for every `a : R`, either `a` is a unit or `1 - a` is a unit. -/
