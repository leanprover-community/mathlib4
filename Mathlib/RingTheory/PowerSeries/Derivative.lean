# Definitions

In this file we define an operation `derivative` (formal differentiation)
on the ring of formal power series in one variable (over an arbitrary commutative semiring).

Under suitable assumptions, we prove that two power series are equal if their derivatives
are equal and their constant terms are equal. This will give us a simple tool for proving
power series identities. For example, one can easily prove the power series identity
$\exp ( \log (1+X)) = 1+X$ by differentiating twice.

## Main Definition

- `PowerSeries.derivative R : Derivation R R⟦X⟧ R⟦X⟧` the formal derivative operation.
  This is abbreviated `d⁄dX R`.
