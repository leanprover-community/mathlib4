# Power series over rings with no zero divisors

This file proves, using the properties of orders of power series,
that `R⟦X⟧` is an integral domain when `R` is.

We then state various results about `R⟦X⟧` with `R` an integral domain.

##  Instance

If `R` has `NoZeroDivisors`, then so does `R⟦X⟧`.
