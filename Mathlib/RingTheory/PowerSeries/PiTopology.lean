/-! # Product topology on power series

Let `R` be with `Semiring R` and `TopologicalSpace R`
In this file we define the topology on `PowerSeries œÉ R`
that corresponds to the simple convergence on its coefficients.
It is the coarsest topology for which all coefficients maps are continuous.

When `R` has `UniformSpace R`, we define the corresponding uniform structure.

This topology can be included by writing `open scoped PowerSeries.WithPiTopology`.

When the type of coefficients has the discrete topology, it corresponds to the topology defined by
[N. Bourbaki, *Algebra {II}*, Chapter 4, ¬ß4, n¬∞2][bourbaki1981].

It corresponds with the adic topology but this is not proved here.

- `PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_constantCoeff_isNilpotent`,
`PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.isTopologicallyNilpotent_of_constantCoeff_zero`: if the constant
coefficient of `f` is nilpotent, or vanishes, then `f` is topologically nilpotent.

- `PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.isTopologicallyNilpotent_iff_constantCoeff_isNilpotent` :
assuming the base ring has the discrete topology, `f` is topologically nilpotent iff the constant
coefficient of `f` is nilpotent.

- `PowerSeries.WithPiTopology.hasSum_of_monomials_self` : viewed as an infinite sum, a power
series converges to itself.

TODO: add the similar result for the series of homogeneous components.

## Instances

- If `R` is a topological (semi)ring, then so is `PowerSeries œÉ R`.
- If the topology of `R` is T0 or T2, then so is that of `PowerSeries œÉ R`.
- If `R` is a `IsUniformAddGroup`, then so is `PowerSeries œÉ R`.
- If `R` is complete, then so is `PowerSeries œÉ R`.
