# Grassmannians

## Main definitions

- `Module.Grassmannian`: `G(k, M; R)` is the `k`ᵗʰ Grassmannian of the `R`-module `M`. It is defined
  to be the set of submodules of `M` whose **quotient** is locally free of rank `k`. Note that there
  is another convention in literature where the `k`ᵗʰ Grassmannian would instead be `k`-dimensional
  subspaces of a given vector space over a field. See implementation notes below.

## Implementation notes

In the literature, two conventions exist:

1. The `k`ᵗʰ Grassmannian parametrises `k`-dimensional **subspaces** of a given finite-dimensional
   vector space over a field.
2. The `k`ᵗʰ Grassmannian parametrises **quotients** that are locally free of rank `k`, of a given
   module over a ring.

For the purposes of Algebraic Geometry, the first definition here cannot be generalised to obtain
a scheme to represent the functor, which is why the second definition is the one chosen by
[Grothendieck, EGA I.9.7.3][grothendieck-1971] (Springer edition only), and in EGA V.11
(unpublished).

The first definition in the stated generality (i.e. over a field `F`, and finite-dimensional vector
space `V`) can be recovered from the second definition by noting that `k`-dimensional subspaces of
`V` are canonically equivalent to `(n-k)`-dimensional quotients of `V`, and also to `k`-dimensional
quotients of `V*`, the dual of `V`. In symbols, this means that the first definition is equivalent
to `G(n - k, V; F)` and also to `G(k, V →ₗ[F] F; F)`, where `n` is the dimension of `V`.

## TODO
- Define and recover the subspace-definition (i.e. the first definition above).
- Define the functor `Module.Grassmannian.functor R M k` that sends an `R`-algebra `A` to the set
  `G(k, A ⊗[R] M; A)`.
- Define `chart x` indexed by `x : Fin k → M` as a subtype consisting of those
  `N ∈ G(k, A ⊗[R] M; A)` such that the composition `R^k → M → M⧸N` is an isomorphism.
- Define `chartFunctor x` to turn `chart x` into a subfunctor of `Module.Grassmannian.functor`. This
  will correspond to an affine open chart in the Grassmannian.
- Grassmannians for schemes and quasi-coherent sheaf of modules.
- Representability of `Module.Grassmannian.functor R M k`.
