# The filtered ring morphisms on rings

In this file, we define the filtered ring morphisms on rings and prove some basic properties of
them.

# Main definitions

* `FilteredHom` : Defines a morphism between general filtration (filtration of sets) that preserves
both the main and auxiliary filtered structures. This class describes a structure-preserving map
between two filtered sets `IsFiltration FA FA_lt` and `IsFiltration FB FB_lt` (types `A` and `B`).

* FilteredHom.comp : Defines the composition of two filtered morphisms
`f : FilteredHom FA FA_lt FB FB_lt` and `g : FilteredHom FB FB_lt FC FC_lt`, resulting in a new
morphism `f ∘ g : FilteredHom FA FA_lt FC FC_lt`.

* `FilteredRingHom` : Defines a morphism between filtered rings that preserves both the ring and
filtered morphism structures. This class combines the properties of a ring homomorphism and a
filtered morphism, ensuring that both the structure of the ring and its filtration are maintained
under the morphism.

`R →+* S` retrieves the ring homomorphism component of a filtered ring homomorphism,
which is responsible for preserving the ring structure between the source and target rings.
It allows direct access to the ring-theoretic aspects of the morphism, enabling operations
and proofs that focus on the algebraic structure independent of the filtration layers.

* `FilteredRingHom.IsStrict` : Defines a strict morphism, which is a filtered ring morphism `f`
between filtered rings `IsRingFiltration FR FR_lt` and `IsRingFiltration FS FS_lt`. It is strict if
`∀ p : ι`, the image of the `p`-th filtration layer of `FR` and `FR_lt` under `f` is exactly the
intersection of the image of `f` with the `p`-th filtration layer of `FS` and `FS_lt`, respectively.

* `FilteredRingHom.comp` : Defines the composition of filtered ring morphisms. Given two filtered
morphisms `f : FilteredRingHom FR FR_lt FS FS_lt` and `g : FilteredRingHom FS FS_lt FT FT_lt`, their
composition `g ∘ f` is defined by composing the underlying ring homomorphisms and ensuring
compatibility with the filtration structures.

* `Gf` : Defines the induced morphism on the `i`-th graded piece of the associated graded ring.
**Mathematically, it is `(Gf f i) ⟦x⟧ = ⟦f.toRingHom x⟧`**
(`x : FR i`, `⟦a⟧ : GradedPiece FR FR_lt i`)
Given a filtered ring homomorphism `f : FilteredRingHom FR FR_lt FS FS_lt`, this function takes an
element in the `i`-th graded piece of `FR` (represented as a quotient `FR i / FR_lt i`) and maps it
to the corresponding graded piece of `FS` by applying the ring homomorphism `f`, ensuring that the
result lies within the `i`-th filtration layer of `FS`. The construction respects the quotient
equivalence relation, making it a well-defined additive group homomorphism.

* `G` : Defines the induced graded ring morphism between associated graded rings.
**Mathematically, it is `G f = ⨁ Gf f i`**
Specifically, given a filtered ring morphism `f : FilteredRingHom FR FR_lt FS FS_lt`, this function
constructs an AddSubgroup homomorphism `G f` between the associated graded modules
`⨁ (FR i / FR_lt i)` and `⨁ (FS i / FS_lt i)` by applying `Gf f i` component-wise to each graded
piece and combining the results into a direct sum of additive group homomorphisms.
