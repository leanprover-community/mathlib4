# Abstract Formal Power Series
In this file we introduce formal power series as coefficient maps.  We use `structure` instead of
`abbrev`, because we will consider multiplication actions of polynomials and (under boundedness
conditions) other formal series using convolution.

We borrow from `MVPowerSeries`

## Definitions
* `FormalSeries`
## Main results
*
## To do:
* When exponent type is a product, compare with iterating FormalSeries construction
* Boundedness conditions? It looks like smul applied to linear maps to Hahn series is good enough.
* Residues (or more generally, taking the coefficient of one variable)
* Derivatives of Log series
* Hasse derivatives for exponents in a binomial ring.

variable {Γ C : Type*} [DecidableEq Γ]

/-- The type of formal series with coefficients in `C` with exponents in `Γ`.
For example:
 * Formal Taylor series in one variable are obtained with `Γ = ℕ`.
 * Formal Taylor series in a set `X` of variables is obtained with
 `Γ = (∀ (x : X), ℤ)`.

See the type `MonomialType` for the standard way of constructing the appropriate `Γ`.
