/-! # Product topology on multivariate power series

Let `R` be with `Semiring R` and `TopologicalSpace R`
In this file we define the topology on `MvPowerSeries σ R`
that corresponds to the simple convergence on its coefficients.
It is the coarsest topology for which all coefficient maps are continuous.

When `R` has `UniformSpace R`, we define the corresponding uniform structure.

This topology can be included by writing `open scoped MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology`.

When the type of coefficients has the discrete topology,
it corresponds to the topology defined by [bourbaki1981], chapter 4, §4, n°2.

It is *not* the adic topology in general.

## Main results

- `MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology.tendsto_pow_zero_of_constantCoeff_nilpotent`,
  `MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology.tendsto_pow_zero_of_constantCoeff_zero`: if the constant coefficient
  of `f` is nilpotent, or vanishes, then the powers of `f` converge to zero.

- `MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology.tendsto_pow_of_constantCoeff_nilpotent_iff` : the powers of `f`
  converge to zero iff the constant coefficient of `f` is nilpotent.

- `MvPowerSeries.WithPiTopology.hasSum_of_monomials_self` : viewed as an infinite sum, a power
  series converges to itself.

TODO: add the similar result for the series of homogeneous components.

## Instances

- If `R` is a topological (semi)ring, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ R`.
- If the topology of `R` is T0 or T2, then so is that of `MvPowerSeries σ R`.
- If `R` is a `UniformAddGroup`, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ R`.
- If `R` is complete, then so is `MvPowerSeries σ R`.
