# Ramification index

Given a prime ideal `q` of an `R`-algebra `S`, the ramification index of `q` over `R` is defined
to be the length of the quotient `Sq/pSq` as an `Sq`-module where `Sq` is the localization of `S` at
`q`, `p` is the preimage of `q` in `R`, and `pSq` is the image of `p` in `Sq`.

/-- Given a prime ideal `q` of an `R`-algebra `S`, the ramification index of `q` over `R` is defined
to be the length of the quotient `Sq/pSq` as an `Sq`-module where `Sq` is the localization of `S` at
`q`, `p` is the preimage of `q` in `R`, and `pSq` is the image of `p` in `Sq`.

When `q` is not prime, we use a junk value of `0`.

This will eventually replace the existing definition of `Ideal.ramificationIdx`. -/
