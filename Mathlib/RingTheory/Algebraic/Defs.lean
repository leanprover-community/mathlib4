# Algebraic elements and algebraic extensions

An element of an R-algebra is algebraic over R if it is the root of a nonzero polynomial.
An R-algebra is algebraic over R if and only if all its elements are algebraic over R.

## Main definitions

* `IsAlgebraic`: algebraic elements of an algebra.
* `Transcendental`: transcendental elements of an algebra are those that are not algebraic.
* `Subalgebra.IsAlgebraic`: a subalgebra is algebraic if all its elements are algebraic.
* `Algebra.IsAlgebraic`: an algebra is algebraic if all its elements are algebraic.
* `Algebra.Transcendental`: an algebra is transcendental if some element is transcendental.

## Main results

* `transcendental_iff`: an element `x : A` is transcendental over `R` iff out of `R[X]`
  only the zero polynomial evaluates to 0 at `x`.
* `Subalgebra.isAlgebraic_iff`: a subalgebra is algebraic iff it is algebraic as an algebra.
