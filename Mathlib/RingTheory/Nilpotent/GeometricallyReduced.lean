# Geometrically reduced algebras

In this file we introduce geometrically reduced algebras.
For a field `k`, we say that a `k`-algebra `A` is geometrically reduced (`IsGeometricallyReduced`)
if the tensor product `AlgebraicClosure k ⊗[k] A` is reduced.

## Main results
- `IsReduced.tensor_of_flat_of_forall_fg`: if `R` is a commutative ring and `A` and `C` are
  `R`-algebras, such that `C ⊗[R] B` is reduced for all finitely generated `R` subalgebras `B` of
  `A`, then `C ⊗[R] A` is reduced.

## References
- See [https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05DS] for some theory of geometrically reduced algebras.
  Note that their definition differs from the one here, we still need a proof that these are
  equivalent.
