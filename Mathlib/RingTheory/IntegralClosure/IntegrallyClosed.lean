# Integrally closed rings

An integrally closed ring `R` contains all the elements of `Frac(R)` that are
integral over `R`. A special case of integrally closed rings are the Dedekind domains.

## Main definitions

* `IsIntegrallyClosedIn R A` states `R` contains all integral elements of `A`
* `IsIntegrallyClosed R` states `R` contains all integral elements of `Frac(R)`

## Main results

* `isIntegrallyClosed_iff K`, where `K` is a fraction field of `R`, states `R`
  is integrally closed iff it is the integral closure of `R` in `K`

## TODO Related notions

The following definitions are closely related, especially in their applications in Mathlib.

A *normal domain* is a domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions.
[Stacks: normal domain](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/037B#0309)
Normal domains are the major use case of `IsIntegrallyClosed` at the time of writing, and we have
quite a few results that can be moved wholesale to a new `NormalDomain` definition.
In fact, before PR https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/6126 `IsIntegrallyClosed` was exactly defined to be a normal domain.
(So you might want to copy some of its API when you define normal domains.)

A normal ring means that localizations at all prime ideals are normal domains.
[Stacks: normal ring](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/037B#00GV)
This implies `IsIntegrallyClosed`,
[Stacks: Tag 034M](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/037B#034M)
but is equivalent to it only under some conditions (reduced + finitely many minimal primes),
[Stacks: Tag 030C](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/037B#030C)
in which case it's also equivalent to being a finite product of normal domains.

We'd need to add these conditions if we want exactly the products of Dedekind domains.

In fact noetherianity is sufficient to guarantee finitely many minimal primes, so `IsDedekindRing`
could be defined as `IsReduced`, `IsNoetherian`, `Ring.DimensionLEOne`, and either
`IsIntegrallyClosed` or `NormalDomain`. If we use `NormalDomain` then `IsReduced` is automatic,
but we could also consider a version of `NormalDomain` that only requires the localizations are
`IsIntegrallyClosed` but may not be domains, and that may not equivalent to the ring itself being
`IsIntegallyClosed` (even for noetherian rings?).
