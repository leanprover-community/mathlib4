# Integral closure as a characteristic predicate

## Main definitions

Let `R` be a `CommRing` and let `A` be an R-algebra.

* `IsIntegralClosure R A` : the characteristic predicate stating `A` is the integral closure of `R`
  in `B`, i.e. that an element of `B` is integral over `R` iff it is an element of
  (the image of) `A`.
