# Integral closure of a subring.

If A is an R-algebra then `a : A` is integral over R if it is a root of a monic polynomial
with coefficients in R. Enough theory is developed to prove that integral elements
form a sub-R-algebra of A.

## Main definitions

Let `R` be a `CommRing` and let `A` be an R-algebra.

* `RingHom.IsIntegralElem (f : R →+* A) (x : A)` : `x` is integral with respect to the map `f`,

* `IsIntegral (x : A)`  : `x` is integral over `R`, i.e., is a root of a monic polynomial with
                          coefficients in `R`.
* `integralClosure R A` : the integral closure of `R` in `A`, regarded as a sub-`R`-algebra of `A`.

/-- `IsIntegralClosure A R B` is the characteristic predicate stating `A` is
the integral closure of `R` in `B`,
i.e. that an element of `B` is integral over `R` iff it is an element of (the image of) `A`.
