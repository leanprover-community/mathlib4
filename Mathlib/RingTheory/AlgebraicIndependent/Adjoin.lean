# Algebraic Independence

This file concerns adjoining an algebraic independent family to a field.

## Main definitions

* `AlgebraicIndependent.aevalEquivField` - The canonical isomorphism from the rational function
  field ring to the intermediate field generated by an algebraic independent family.

* `AlgebraicIndependent.reprField` - The canonical map from the intermediate field generated by an
  algebraic independent family into the rational function field. It is the inverse of
  `AlgebraicIndependent.aevalEquivField`.
