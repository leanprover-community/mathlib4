# Bracket Notation
This file provides notation which can be used for the Lie bracket, for the commutator of two
subgroups, and for other similar operations.

## Main Definitions

* `Bracket L M` for a binary operation that takes something in `L` and something in `M` and
produces something in `M`. Defining an instance of this structure gives access to the notation `⁅ ⁆`

## Notation

We introduce the notation `⁅x, y⁆` for the `bracket` of any `Bracket` structure. Note that
these are the Unicode "square with quill" brackets rather than the usual square brackets.
-/

/-- The `Bracket` class has three intended uses:
  1. for certain binary operations on structures, like the product `⁅x, y⁆` of two elements
    `x`, `y` in a Lie algebra or the commutator of two elements `x` and `y` in a group.
  2. for certain actions of one structure on another, like the action `⁅x, m⁆` of an element `x`
    of a Lie algebra on an element `m` in one of its modules (analogous to `SMul` in the
    associative setting).
  3. for binary operations on substructures, like the commutator `⁅H, K⁆` of two subgroups `H` and
     `K` of a group. -/
class Bracket (L M : Type*) where
  /-- `⁅x, y⁆` is the result of a bracket operation on elements `x` and `y`.
  It is supported by the `Bracket` typeclass. -/
