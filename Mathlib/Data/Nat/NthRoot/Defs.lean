# Definition of `Nat.nthRoot`

In this file we define `Nat.nthRoot n a` to be the floor of the `n`th root of `a`.
The function is defined in terms of natural numbers with no dependencies outside of prelude.

/-- `Nat.nthRoot n a = ⌊(a : ℝ) ^ (1 / n : ℝ)⌋₊` defined in terms of natural numbers.

We use Newton's method to find a root of $x^n = a$,
so it converges superexponentially fast. -/

      /-- Auxiliary definition for `Nat.nthRoot`.

      Given natural numbers `n`, `a`, `fuel`, `guess`
      such that `⌊(a : ℝ) ^ (1 / (n + 2) : ℝ)⌋₊ ≤ guess ≤ fuel`,
      returns `⌊(a : ℝ) ^ (1 / (n + 2) : ℝ)⌋₊`.

      The auxiliary number `guess` is the current approximation in Newton's method,
      tracked in the arguments so that the definition uses a tail recursion
      which is unfolded into a loop by the compiler.

      The auxiliary number `fuel` is an upper estimate on the number of steps in Newton's method.
      Any number `fuel ≥ guess` is guaranteed to work, but smaller numbers may work as well.
      If `fuel` is too small, then `Nat.nthRoot.go` returns the result of the `fuel`th step
      of Newton's method.
