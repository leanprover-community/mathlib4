# Hyperoperation sequence

This file defines the Hyperoperation sequence.
`hyperoperation 0 m k = k + 1`
`hyperoperation 1 m k = m + k`
`hyperoperation 2 m k = m * k`
`hyperoperation 3 m k = m ^ k`
`hyperoperation (n + 3) m 0 = 1`
`hyperoperation (n + 1) m (k + 1) = hyperoperation n m (hyperoperation (n + 1) m k)`
