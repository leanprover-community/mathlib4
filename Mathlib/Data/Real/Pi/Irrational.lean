# `Real.pi` is irrational

The main result of this file is `irrational_pi`.

The proof is adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational#Cartwright's_proof.

The proof idea is as follows.
* Define a sequence of integrals `I n θ = ∫ x in (-1)..1, (1 - x ^ 2) ^ n * cos (x * θ)`.
* Give a recursion formula for `I (n + 2) θ * θ ^ 2` in terms of `I n θ` and `I (n + 1) θ`.
  Note we do not find it helpful to define `J` as in the above proof, and instead work directly
  with `I`.
* Define polynomials with integer coefficients `sinPoly n` and `cosPoly n` such that
  `I n θ * θ ^ (2 * n + 1) = n ! * (sinPoly n θ * sin θ + cosPoly n θ * cos θ)`.
  Note that in the informal proof, these polynomials are not defined explicitly, but we find it
  useful to define them by recursion.
* Show that both these polynomials have degree bounded by `n`.
* Show that `0 < I n (π / 2) ≤ 2` for all `n`.
* Now we can finish: if `π / 2` is rational, write it as `a / b` with `a, b > 0`. Then
  `b ^ (2 * n + 1) * sinPoly n (a / b)` is a positive integer by the degree bound. But it is equal
  to `a ^ (2 * n + 1) / n ! * I n (π / 2) ≤ 2 * a * (2 * n + 1) / n !`, which converges to 0 as
  `n → ∞`.

Auxiliary for the proof that `π` is irrational.
While it is most natural to give the recursive formula for `I (n + 2) θ`, as well as give the second
base case of `I 1 θ`, it is in fact more convenient to give the recursive formula for `I (n + 1) θ`
in terms of `I n θ` and `I (n - 1) θ` (note the natural subtraction!).
Despite the usually inconvenient subtraction, this in fact allows deducing both of the above facts
with significantly fewer analysis computations.
In addition, note the `0 ^ n` on the right hand side - this is intentional, and again allows
combining the proof of the "usual" recursion formula and the base case `I 1 θ`.
