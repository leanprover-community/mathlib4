open scoped NNReal

/-- Although the instance `RCLike.toStarOrderedRing` exists, it is locked behind the
`ComplexOrder` scope because currently the order on `ℂ` is not enabled globally. But we
want `StarOrderedRing ℝ` to be available globally, so we include this instance separately.
In addition, providing this instance here makes it available earlier in the import
hierarchy; otherwise in order to access it we would need to import `Mathlib.Analysis.RCLike.Basic`.
