# Doubly stochastic matrices

## Main definitions

* `doublyStochastic`: a square matrix is doubly stochastic if all entries are nonnegative, and left
  or right multiplication by the vector of all 1s gives the vector of all 1s. Equivalently, all
  row and column sums are equal to 1.

## Main statements

* `convex_doublyStochastic`: The set of doubly stochastic matrices is convex.
* `permMatrix_mem_doublyStochastic`: Any permutation matrix is doubly stochastic.

## TODO

Define the submonoids of row-stochastic and column-stochastic matrices.
Show that the submonoid of doubly stochastic matrices is the meet of them, or redefine it as such.

/--
A matrix is `s` times a doubly stochastic matrix iff all entries are nonnegative, and all row and
column sums are equal to `s`.

This lemma is useful for the proof of Birkhoff's theorem - in particular because it allows scaling
by nonnegative factors rather than positive ones only.
