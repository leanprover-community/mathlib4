# `Ineq` datatype

This file contains an enum `Ineq` (whose constructors are `eq`, `le`, `lt`), and operations
involving it. The type `Ineq` is one of the fundamental objects manipulated by the `linarith` and
`linear_combination` tactics.

terms. -/

`max R1 R2` computes the strength of the sum of two inequalities. If `t1 R1 0` and `t2 R2 0`,
then `t1 + t2 (max R1 R2) 0`.

/-- Given an expression `e`, parse it as a `=`, `≤` or `<`, and return this relation (as a
`Linarith.Ineq`) together with the type in which the (in)equality occurs and the two sides of the
(in)equality.

This function is more naturally in the `Option` monad, but it is convenient to put in `MetaM`
for compositionality.

  let e ← whnfR (← instantiateMVars e)
  match e.eq? with
  | some p => return (Ineq.eq, p)
  | none =>
  match e.le? with
  | some p => return (Ineq.le, p)
  | none =>
  match e.lt? with
  | some p => return (Ineq.lt, p)
  | none => throwError "Not a comparison: {e}"

/-- Given an expression `e`, parse it as a `=`, `≤` or `<`, or the negation of such, and return this
relation (as a `Linarith.Ineq`) together with the type in which the (in)equality occurs, the two
sides of the (in)equality, and a boolean flag indicating the presence or absence of the `¬`.

This function is more naturally in the `Option` monad, but it is convenient to put in `MetaM`
for compositionality.
