Porting note:

#align_import data.buffer.parser.numeral from "leanprover-community/mathlib"@"2220b0cbab795e73674b8191170b0cc68c6b54a8"
As the parsing framework has completely changed in Lean 4
there is no point porting these files directly.
They can be rewritten from scratch as needed, just as for tactics.
