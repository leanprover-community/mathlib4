# Coercing sets to types.

This file defines `Set.Elem s` as the type of all elements of the set `s`.
More advanced theorems about these definitions are located in other files in `Mathlib/Data/Set`.

## Main definitions

- `Set.Elem`: coercion of a set to a type; it is reducibly equal to `{x // x ∈ s}`;
-/

namespace Set

universe u v w

variable {α : Type u} {β : Type v} {γ : Type w}

/-- Given the set `s`, `Elem s` is the `Type` of element of `s`.

It is currently an abbreviation so that instance coming from `Subtype` are available.
If you're interested in making it a `def`, as it probably should be,
you'll then need to create additional instances (and possibly prove lemmas about them).
See e.g. `Mathlib.Data.Set.Order`.

/-- Coercion from a set to the corresponding subtype. -/
