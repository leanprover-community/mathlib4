# Set Notation

This file defines two pieces of scoped notation related to sets and subtypes.

The first is a coercion; for each `α : Type*` and `s : Set α`, `(↑) : Set s → Set α`
is the function coercing `t : Set s` into a set in the ambient type; i.e. `↑t = Subtype.val '' t`.

The second, for `s t : Set α`, is the notation `s ↓∩ t`, which denotes the intersection
of `s` and `t` as a set in `Set s`.

These notations are developed further in `Data.Set.Functor` and `Data.Set.Subset` respectively.
They are defined here separately so that this file can be added as an exception to the shake linter
and can thus be imported without a linting false positive when only the notation is desired.

namespace Set.Notation
/--
Given two sets `A` and `B`, `A ↓∩ B` denotes the intersection of `A` and `B` as a set in `Set A`.

The notation is short for `((↑) ⁻¹' B : Set A)`, while giving hints to the elaborator
that both `A` and `B` are terms of `Set α` for the same `α`.
This set is the same as `{x : ↑A | ↑x ∈ B}`.

If the `Set.Notation` namespace is open, sets of a subtype coerced to the ambient type are
represented with `↑`.
