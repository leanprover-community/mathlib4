# Cast of integers into fields

This file concerns the canonical homomorphism `ℤ → F`, where `F` is a field.

## Main results

* `Int.cast_div`: if `n` divides `m`, then `↑(m / n) = ↑m / ↑n`
-/


namespace Int

open Nat

variable {α : Type*}

/-- Auxiliary lemma for norm_cast to move the cast `-↑n` upwards to `↑-↑n`.

(The restriction to `DivisionRing` is necessary, otherwise this would also apply in the case where
`R = ℤ` and cause nontermination.)
