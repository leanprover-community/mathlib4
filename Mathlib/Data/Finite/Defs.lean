# Definition of the `Finite` typeclass

This file defines a typeclass `Finite` saying that `α : Sort*` is finite. A type is `Finite` if it
is equivalent to `Fin n` for some `n`. We also define `Infinite α` as a typeclass equivalent to
`¬Finite α`.

The `Finite` predicate has no computational relevance and, being `Prop`-valued, gets to enjoy proof
irrelevance -- it represents the mere fact that the type is finite.  While the `Finite` class also
represents finiteness of a type, a key difference is that a `Fintype` instance represents finiteness
in a computable way: it gives a concrete algorithm to produce a `Finset` whose elements enumerate
the terms of the given type. As such, one generally relies on congruence lemmas when rewriting
expressions involving `Fintype` instances.

Every `Fintype` instance automatically gives a `Finite` instance, see `Fintype.finite`, but not vice
versa. Every `Fintype` instance should be computable since they are meant for computation. If it's
not possible to write a computable `Fintype` instance, one should prefer writing a `Finite` instance
instead.

## Main definitions

* `Finite α` denotes that `α` is a finite type.
* `Infinite α` denotes that `α` is an infinite type.
* `Set.Finite : Set α → Prop`
* `Set.Infinite : Set α → Prop`
* `Set.toFinite` to prove `Set.Finite` for a `Set` from a `Finite` instance.

## Implementation notes

This file defines both the type-level `Finite` class and the set-level `Set.Finite` definition.

The definition of `Finite α` is not just `Nonempty (Fintype α)` since `Fintype` requires
that `α : Type*`, and the definition in this module allows for `α : Sort*`. This means
we can write the instance `Finite.prop`.

A finite set is defined to be a set whose coercion to a type has a `Finite` instance.

There are two components to finiteness constructions. The first is `Fintype` instances for each
construction. This gives a way to actually compute a `Finset` that represents the set, and these
may be accessed using `set.toFinset`. This gets the `Finset` in the correct form, since otherwise
`Finset.univ : Finset s` is a `Finset` for the subtype for `s`. The second component is
"constructors" for `Set.Finite` that give proofs that `Fintype` instances exist classically given
other `Set.Finite` proofs. Unlike the `Fintype` instances, these *do not* use any decidability
instances since they do not compute anything.

/-- A type is `Finite` if it is in bijective correspondence to some `Fin n`.

This is similar to `Fintype`, but `Finite` is a proposition rather than data.
A particular benefit to this is that `Finite` instances are definitionally equal to one another
(due to proof irrelevance) rather than being merely propositionally equal,
and, furthermore, `Finite` instances generally avoid the need for `Decidable` instances.
One other notable difference is that `Finite` allows there to be `Finite p` instances
for all `p : Prop`, which is not allowed by `Fintype` due to universe constraints.
An application of this is that `Finite (x ∈ s → β x)` follows from the general instance for pi
types, assuming `[∀ x, Finite (β x)]`.
Implementation note: this is a reason `Finite α` is not defined as `Nonempty (Fintype α)`.

Every `Fintype` instance provides a `Finite` instance via `Finite.of_fintype`.
Conversely, one can noncomputably create a `Fintype` instance from a `Finite` instance
via `Fintype.ofFinite`. In a proof one might write
```lean
  have := Fintype.ofFinite α
```
to obtain such an instance.

Do not write noncomputable `Fintype` instances; instead write `Finite` instances
and use this `Fintype.ofFinite` interface.
The `Fintype` instances should be relied upon to be computable for evaluation purposes.

Theorems should use `Finite` instead of `Fintype`, unless definitions in the theorem statement
require `Fintype`.
Definitions should prefer `Finite` as well, unless it is important that the definitions
are meant to be computable in the reduction or `#eval` sense.
