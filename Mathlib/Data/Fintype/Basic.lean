# Finite types

This file defines a typeclass to state that a type is finite.

## Main declarations

* `Fintype α`: Typeclass saying that a type is finite. It takes as fields a `Finset` and a proof
  that all terms of type `α` are in it.
* `Finset.univ`: The finset of all elements of a fintype.

/-- `Fintype α` means that `α` is finite, i.e. there are only
  finitely many distinct elements of type `α`. The evidence of this
  is a finset `elems` (a list up to permutation without duplicates),
  together with a proof that everything of type `α` is in the list. -/
class Fintype (α : Type _) where
  /-- The `Finset` of elements of a `Fintype`. -/
  elems : Finset α
  /-- The proof that every term of the type is contained in the `Finset` of elements. -/
  complete : ∀ x : α, x ∈ elems

variable [Fintype α]

/-- `univ` is the universal finite set of type `Finset α` implied from
  the assumption `Fintype α`. -/

@[simp] theorem mem_univ (x : α) : x ∈ (univ : Finset α) := Fintype.complete x
