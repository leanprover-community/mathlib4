# Pigeonhole principles in finite types

## Main declarations

We provide the following versions of the pigeonholes principle.
* `Fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt` and `isEmpty_of_card_lt`: Finitely many pigeons and
  pigeonholes. Weak formulation.
* `Finite.exists_ne_map_eq_of_infinite`: Infinitely many pigeons in finitely many pigeonholes.
  Weak formulation.
* `Finite.exists_infinite_fiber`: Infinitely many pigeons in finitely many pigeonholes. Strong
  formulation.

Some more pigeonhole-like statements can be found in `Data.Fintype.CardEmbedding`.

/-- If `‖β‖ < ‖α‖` there are no embeddings `α ↪ β`.
This is a formulation of the pigeonhole principle.

Note this cannot be an instance as it needs `h`. -/

/-- The pigeonhole principle for infinitely many pigeons in finitely many pigeonholes. If there are
infinitely many pigeons in finitely many pigeonholes, then there are at least two pigeons in the
same pigeonhole.

/-- The strong pigeonhole principle for infinitely many pigeons in
finitely many pigeonholes.  If there are infinitely many pigeons in
finitely many pigeonholes, then there is a pigeonhole with infinitely
many pigeons.
