/-! # Monadic lazy lists.

Lazy lists with "lazyness" controlled by an arbitrary monad.

The inductive construction is unsafe (indeed, we can build infinite objects).
This isn't so bad, as the typical use is with the tactic monad, in any case.
Typical usage will be to do computations in `ListM`, and then eventually extract
the first result (with `head` or `firstM`), first several results (using `take`),
or all results (using `force`). At this point you can use the `unsafe` term elaborator
from `Std.Util.TermUnsafe` to return to the "safe" world.

As we're unsafe anyway, we don't bother with proofs about these constructions.
