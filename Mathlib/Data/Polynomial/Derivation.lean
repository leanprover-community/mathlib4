# Derivations of univariate polynomials

In this file we prove that an `R`-derivation of `Polynomial R` is determined by its value on `X`.
We also provide a constructor `Polynomial.mkDerivation` that
builds a derivation from its value on `X`, and a linear equivalence
`Polynomial.mkDerivationEquiv` between `A` and `Derivation (Polynomial R) A`.
