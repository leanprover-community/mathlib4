This is a makeshift theory of the cardinality of a list. Any list can be taken to represent the
finite set of its elements. Cardinality counts the number of distinct elements. Cardinality
respects equivalence and is preserved by any mapping that is injective on its elements.

It might make sense to remove this when we have a proper theory of finite sets.
