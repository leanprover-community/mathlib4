/-! # Unordered tuples of elements of a list

Defines `List.sym` and the specialized `List.sym2` for computing lists of all unordered n-tuples
from a given list. These are list versions of `Nat.multichoose`.

## Main declarations

* `List.sym`: `xs.sym n` is a list of all unordered n-tuples of elements from `xs`,
  with multiplicity. The list's values are in `Sym α n`.
* `List.sym2`: `xs.sym2` is a list of all unordered pairs of elements from `xs`,
  with multiplicity. The list's values are in `Sym2 α`.

## Todo

* Prove `protected theorem Perm.sym (n : ℕ) {xs ys : List α} (h : xs ~ ys) : xs.sym n ~ ys.sym n`
  and lift the result to `Multiset` and `Finset`.
