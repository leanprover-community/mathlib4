# Lemmas about List.*Idx functions.

Some specification lemmas for `List.mapIdx`, `List.mapIdxM`, `List.foldlIdx` and `List.foldrIdx`.

As of 2025-01-29, these are not used anywhere in Mathlib. Moreover, with
`List.enum` and `List.enumFrom` being replaced by `List.zipIdx`
in Lean's `nightly-2025-01-29` release, they now use deprecated functions and theorems.
Rather than updating this unused material, we are deprecating it.
Anyone wanting to restore this material is welcome to do so, but will need to update uses of
`List.enum` and `List.enumFrom` to use `List.zipIdx` instead.
However, note that this material will later be implemented in the Lean standard library.
