# Levenshtein distances

We define the Levenshtein edit distance `levenshtein C xy ys` between two `List α`,
with a customizable cost structure `C` for the `delete`, `insert`, and `substitute` operations.

As an auxiliary function, we define `suffixLevenshtein C xs ys`, which gives the list of distances
from each suffix of `xs` to `ys`.
This is defined by recursion on `ys`, using the internal function `Levenshtein.impl`,
which computes `suffixLevenshtein C xs (y :: ys)` using `xs`, `y`, and `suffixLevenshtein C xs ys`.
(This corresponds to the usual algorithm
using the last two rows of the matrix of distances between suffixes.)

After setting up these definitions, we prove lemmas specifying their behaviour,
particularly

```
theorem suffixLevenshtein_eq_tails_map :
    (suffixLevenshtein C xs ys).1 = xs.tails.map fun xs' => levenshtein C xs' ys := ...
```

and

```
theorem levenshtein_cons_cons :
    levenshtein C (x :: xs) (y :: ys) =
    min (C.delete x + levenshtein C xs (y :: ys))
      (min (C.insert y + levenshtein C (x :: xs) ys)
        (C.substitute x y + levenshtein C xs ys)) := ...
```

(Implementation detail for `levenshtein`)

Given a list `xs` and the Levenshtein distances from each suffix of `xs` to some other list `ys`,
compute the Levenshtein distances from each suffix of `xs` to `y :: ys`.

(Note that we don't actually need to know `ys` itself here, so it is not an argument.)

The return value is a list of length `x.length + 1`,
and it is convenient for the recursive calls that we bundle this list
with a proof that it is non-empty.

`suffixLevenshtein C xs ys` computes the Levenshtein distance

The first element of this list is the Levenshtein distance from `xs` to `ys`.

Note that if the cost functions do not satisfy the inequalities

(or if any values are negative)
then the edit distances calculated here may not agree with the general
geodesic distance on the edit graph.
