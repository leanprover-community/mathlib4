# `Estimator` for Levenshtein distance.

The usual algorithm for computing Levenshtein distances
provides successively better lower bounds for the Levenshtein distance as it runs,
as proved in `Mathlib.Data.List.EditDistance.Bounds`.

In this file we package that fact as an instance of
```
Estimator (Thunk.mk fun _ => levenshtein C xs ys) (LevenshteinEstimator C xs ys)
```
allowing us to use the `Estimator` framework for Levenshtein distances.

This is then used in the implementation of `rewrite_search`
to avoid needing the entire edit distance calculation in unlikely search paths.

/--
Data showing that the Levenshtein distance from `xs` to `ys`
is bounded below by the minimum Levenshtein distance between some suffix of `xs`
and a particular suffix of `ys`.

This bound is (non-strict) monotone as we take longer suffixes of `ys`.

This is an auxiliary definition for the later `LevenshteinEstimator`:
this variant constructs a lower bound for the pair consisting of
the Levenshtein distance from `xs` to `ys`,
along with the length of `ys`.
