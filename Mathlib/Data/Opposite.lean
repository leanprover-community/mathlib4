In this file we define a structure `Opposite α` containing a single field of type `α` and
two bijections `op : α → αᵒᵖ` and `unop : αᵒᵖ → α`. If `α` is a category, then `αᵒᵖ` is the
opposite category, with all arrows reversed.

universe v u

-- morphism levels before object levels. See note [CategoryTheory universes].
variable (α : Sort u)

-- porting note: in mathlib, `opposite α` was a type synonym for `α`, but if we did
-- the same in Lean4, one could write problematic definitions like:
-- example (X : C) : Cᵒᵖ := X
-- example {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y): op Y ⟶ op X := f
/-- The type of objects of the opposite of `α`; used to define the opposite category.

  Now that Lean 4 supports definitional eta equality for records,
  both `unop (op X) = X` and `op (unop X) = X` are definitional equalities.
