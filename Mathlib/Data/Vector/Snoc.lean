  This file establishes a `snoc : Vector α n → α → Vector α (n+1)` operation, that appends a single
  element to the back of a vector.

  It provides a collection of lemmas that show how different `Vector` operations reduce when their
  argument is `snoc xs x`.

  Also, an alternative, reverse, induction principle is added, that breaks down a vector into
  `snoc xs x` for its inductive case. Effectively doing induction from right-to-left

section Induction

/-- Define `C v` by *reverse* induction on `v : Vector α n`.
    That is, break the vector down starting from the right-most element, using `snoc`

    This function has two arguments: `nil` handles the base case on `C nil`,
    and `snoc` defines the inductive step using `∀ x : α, C xs → C (xs.snoc x)`.

    This can be used as `induction v using Vector.revInductionOn`. -/
