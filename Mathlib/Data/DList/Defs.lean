# Difference list

This file provides a few results about `DList`, which is defined in `Batteries`.

A difference list is a function that, given a list, returns the original content of the
difference list prepended to the given list. It is useful to represent elements of a given type
as `a₁ + ... + aₙ` where `+ : α → α → α` is any operation, without actually computing.

This structure supports `O(1)` `append` and `push` operations on lists, making it
useful for append-heavy uses such as logging and pretty printing.
