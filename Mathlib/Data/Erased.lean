# A type for VM-erased data

This file defines a type `Erased α` which is classically isomorphic to `α`,
but erased in the VM. That is, at runtime every value of `Erased α` is
represented as `0`, just like types and proofs.

  of `Erased α` are erased in the VM in the same way as types
  and proofs. This can be used to track data without storing it
  literally. -/
