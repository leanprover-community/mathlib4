/-! # Class of grading-preserving functions

We define `GradedFunLike F 𝒜 ℬ` where `𝒜` and `ℬ` represent some sort of grading. This class
extends `FunLike A B` where `A` and `B` are the underlying types.
-/

/-- The class `GradedFunLike F 𝒜 ℬ` expresses that terms of type `F` have an injective coercion to
grading-preserving functions from `A` to `B`, where `𝒜` is a grading on `A` and `ℬ` is a grading on
`B`. This typeclass extends `FunLike F A B`, so it is **not** necessary to repeat `[FunLike F A B]`
in the assumptions. This typeclass is used in the charactersation of certain types of graded
homomorphisms, such as `GradedRingHom` and `GradedAlgHom`. For example, what would be called
`"GradedRingHomClass F 𝒜 ℬ`" would be expressed as `[GradedFunLike F 𝒜 ℬ] [RingHomClass F A B]`.
