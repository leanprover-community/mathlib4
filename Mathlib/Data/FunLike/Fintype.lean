# Finiteness of `DFunLike` types

We show a type `F` with a `DFunLike F α β` is finite if both `α` and `β` are finite.
This corresponds to the following two pairs of declarations:

 * `DFunLike.fintype` is a definition stating all `DFunLike`s are finite if their domain and
   codomain are.
 * `DFunLike.finite` is a lemma stating all `DFunLike`s are finite if their domain and
   codomain are.
 * `FunLike.fintype` is a non-dependent version of `DFunLike.fintype` and
 * `FunLike.finite` is a non-dependent version of `DFunLike.finite`, because dependent instances
   are harder to infer.

You can use these to produce instances for specific `DFunLike` types.
(Although there might be options for `Fintype` instances with better definitional behaviour.)
They can't be instances themselves since they can cause loops.
