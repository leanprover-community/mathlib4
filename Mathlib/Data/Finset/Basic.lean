# Finite sets

Terms of type `Finset α` are one way of talking about finite subsets of `α` in mathlib.
Below, `Finset α` is defined as a structure with 2 fields:

  1. `val` is a `Multiset α` of elements;
  2. `nodup` is a proof that `val` has no duplicates.

Finsets in Lean are constructive in that they have an underlying `List` that enumerates their
elements. In particular, any function that uses the data of the underlying list cannot depend on its
ordering. This is handled on the `Multiset` level by multiset API, so in most cases one needn't
worry about it explicitly.

## Main declarations

### Main definitions

* `Finset`: Defines a type for the finite subsets of `α`.
  Constructing a `Finset` requires two pieces of data: `val`, a `Multiset α` of elements,
  and `nodup`, a proof that `val` has no duplicates.
* `Finset.Membership`: Defines membership `a ∈ (s : Finset α)`.
