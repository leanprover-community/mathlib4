# Nontrivial types

A type is *nontrivial* if it contains at least two elements. This is useful in particular for rings
(where it is equivalent to the fact that zero is different from one) and for vector spaces
(where it is equivalent to the fact that the dimension is positive).

We introduce a typeclass `nontrivial` formalizing this property.
-/

/-- Predicate typeclass for expressing that a type is not reduced to a single element. In rings,
this is equivalent to `0 ≠ 1`. In vector spaces, this is equivalent to positive dimension. -/
class Nontrivial (α : Type _) : Prop where
  /-- In a nontrivial type, there exists a pair of distinct terms. -/
  exists_pair_ne : ∃ x y : α, x ≠ y
