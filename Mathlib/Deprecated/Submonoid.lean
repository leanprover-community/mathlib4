# Unbundled submonoids (deprecated)

This file is deprecated, and is no longer imported by anything in mathlib other than other
deprecated files, and test files. You should not need to import it.

This file defines unbundled multiplicative and additive submonoids. Instead of using this file,
please use `Submonoid G` and `AddSubmonoid A`, defined in `GroupTheory.Submonoid.Basic`.

## Main definitions

`IsAddSubmonoid (S : Set M)` : the predicate that `S` is the underlying subset of an additive
submonoid of `M`. The bundled variant `AddSubmonoid M` should be used in preference to this.

`IsSubmonoid (S : Set M)` : the predicate that `S` is the underlying subset of a submonoid
of `M`. The bundled variant `Submonoid M` should be used in preference to this.
