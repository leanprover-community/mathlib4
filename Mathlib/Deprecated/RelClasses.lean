# Note about deprecated files

This file is deprecated, and is no longer imported by anything in mathlib other than other
deprecated files, and test files. You should not need to import it.

# Unbundled relation classes

In this file we prove some properties of `Is*` classes defined in
`Mathlib/Deprecated/AlgebraClasses.lean`.
