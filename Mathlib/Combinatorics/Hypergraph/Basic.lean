# Undirected hypergraphs

An *undirected hypergraph* (here abbreviated as *hypergraph*) `H` is a generalization of a graph
(see `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Graph` or `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph`) and consists of a set of
*vertices*, usually denoted `V` or `V(H)`, and a set of *hyperedges*, here called *edges* and
denoted `E` or `E(H)`. In contrast with a graph, where edges are unordered pairs of vertices, in
hypergraphs, edges are (unordered) sets of vertices; i.e., they are subsets of the vertex set `V`.

A hypergraph where `V = ∅` and `E = ∅` is *empty*. A hypergraph with a nonempty
vertex set (`V ≠ ∅`) and empty edge set is *trivial*.

If a edge `e` contains only one vertex (i.e., `|e| = 1`), then it is a *loop*.

This module defines `Hypergraph α` for a vertex type `α` (edges are defined as `Set (Set α)`).

## Main definitions

For `H : Hypergraph α`:

* `V(H)` denotes the vertex set of `H` as a term in `Set α`.
* `E(H)` denotes the edge set of `H` as a term in `Set (Set α)`. Hyperedges must be subsets of
    `V(H)`.
* `H.Adj x y` means that there exists some edge containing both `x` and `y` (or, in other
    words, `x` and `y` are incident to some shared edge `e`).
* `H.EAdj e f` means that there exists some vertex that is incident to the edges `e` and
    `f : Set α`.

## Implementation details

This implementation is heavily inspired by Peter Nelson and Jun Kwon's `Graph` implementation,
which was in turn inspired by `Matroid`.

Paraphrasing `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Graph.Basic`:
"The main tradeoff is that parts of the API will need to care about whether a term
`x : α` or `e : Set α` is a 'real' vertex or edge of the graph, rather than something outside
the vertex or edge set. This is an issue, but is likely amenable to automation."

Because `edgeSet` is a `Set (Set α)`, rather than a multiset, here we are assuming that
all hypergraphs are *without repeated edge*.

An undirected hypergraph with vertices of type `α` and edges of type `Set α`, as described by vertex
and edge sets `vertexSet : Set α` and `edgeSet : Set (Set α)`.

The requirement `edge_isSubset_vertexSet` ensures that all vertices in edges are part of
`vertexSet`, i.e., all edges are subsets of the `vertexSet`.

If edges `e` and `e'` have the same vertices from `G`, then they have all the same vertices.
This could be phrased as `e = e'`, but this formulation is more useful in combination with the `ext`
tactic.

/--
Predicate for adjacency. Two vertices `x` and `y` are adjacent if there is some edge `e ∈ E(H)`
where `x` and `y` are both incident to `e`.

Note that we do not need to explicitly check that x, y ∈ V(H) here because a vertex that is not in
the vertex set cannot be incident to any edge.
