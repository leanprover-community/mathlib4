# Undirected hypergraphs

An *undirected hypergraph* (here abbreviated as *hypergraph*) `H` is a generalization of a graph
(see `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Graph` or `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph`) and consists of a set of
*vertices*, usually denoted `V` or `V(H)`, and a set of *hyperedges*, denoted `E` or `E(H)`. In
contrast with a graph, where edges are unordered pairs of vertices, in hypergraphs, hyperedges are
(unordered) sets of vertices; i.e., they are subsets of the vertex set `V`.

A hypergraph where `V = ∅` and `E = ∅` is *empty*. A hypergraph with a nonempty
vertex set (`V ≠ ∅`) and empty hyperedge set is *trivial*. A *complete hypergraph* is
one where `E(H) = 𝒫 V(H)`, where `𝒫 V(H)` is the *power set* of the vertex set.

If a hyperedge `e` contains only one vertex (i.e., `|e| = 1`), then it is a *loop*.

This module defines `Hypergraph α` for a vertex type `α` (hyperedges are defined as `Set (Set α)`).

## Main definitions

For `H : Hypergraph α`:

* `V(H)` denotes the vertex set of `H` as a term in `Set α`.
* `E(H)` denotes the hyperedge set of `H` as a term in `Set (Set α)`. Hyperedges must be subsets of
    `V(H)`.
* `H.Adj x y` means that there exists some hyperedge containing both `x` and `y` (or, in other
    words, `x` and `y` are incident on some shared hyperedge `e`).
* `H.EAdj e f` means that there exists some vertex that is incident on both hyperedge `e` and
    hyperedge `f : Set α`.

## Implementation details

This implementation is heavily inspired by Peter Nelson and Jun Kwon's `Graph` implementation,
which was in turn inspired by `Matroid`.

Paraphrasing `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Graph.Basic`:
"The main tradeoff is that parts of the API will need to care about whether a term
`x : α` or `e : Set α` is a 'real' vertex or edge of the graph, rather than something outside
the vertex or edge set. This is an issue, but is likely amenable to automation."

Because `hyperedgeSet` is a `Set (Set α)`, rather than a multiset, here we are assuming that
all hypergraphs are *without repeated hyperedge*.

Predicate for adjacency. Two vertices `x` and `y` are adjacent if there is some
hyperedge `e ∈ E(H)` where `x` and `y` are both incident on `e`.

Note that we do not need to explicitly check that x, y ∈ V(H) here because a vertex that is not in
the vertex set cannot be incident on any hyperedge.
