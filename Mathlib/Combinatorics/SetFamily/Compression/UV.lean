# UV-compressions

This file defines UV-compression. It is an operation on a set family that reduces its shadow.

UV-compressing `a : α` along `u v : α` means replacing `a` by `(a ⊔ u) \ v` if `a` and `u` are
disjoint and `v ≤ a`. In some sense, it's moving `a` from `v` to `u`.

UV-compressions are immensely useful to prove the Kruskal-Katona theorem. The idea is that
compressing a set family might decrease the size of its shadow, so iterated compressions hopefully
minimise the shadow.

## Main declarations

* `UV.compress`: `compress u v a` is `a` compressed along `u` and `v`.
* `UV.compression`: `compression u v s` is the compression of the set family `s` along `u` and `v`.
  It is the compressions of the elements of `s` whose compression is not already in `s` along with
  the element whose compression is already in `s`. This way of splitting into what moves and what
  does not ensures the compression doesn't squash the set family, which is proved by
  `uv.card_compress`.

## Notation

`𝓒` (typed with `\MCC`) is notation for `uv.compression` in locale `finset_family`.

## Notes

Even though our emphasis is on `finset α`, we define UV-compressions more generally in a generalized
boolean algebra, so that one can use it for `set α`.

## TODO

Prove that compressing reduces the size of shadow. This result and some more already exist on the
branch `combinatorics`.
