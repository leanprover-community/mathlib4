# Down-compressions

This file defines down-compression.

Down-compressing `𝒜 : Finset (Finset α)` along `a : α` means removing `a` from the elements of `𝒜`,
when the resulting set is not already in `𝒜`.

## Main declarations

* `Finset.nonMemberSubfamily`: `𝒜.nonMemberSubfamily a` is the subfamily of sets not containing
  `a`.
* `Finset.memberSubfamily`: `𝒜.memberSubfamily a` is the image of the subfamily of sets containing
  `a` under removing `a`.
* `Down.compression`: Down-compression.

## Notation

`𝓓 a 𝒜` is notation for `Down.compress a 𝒜` in locale `SetFamily`.

## References
