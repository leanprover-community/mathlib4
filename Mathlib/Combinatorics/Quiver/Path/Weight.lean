# Path weights in a Quiver

This file defines the weight of a path in a quiver. The weight of a path is the product of the
weights of its edges, where weights are taken from a monoid.

## Main definitions

* `Quiver.Path.weight`: The weight of a path, defined as the multiplicative product of the
  weights of its constituent edges.
* `Quiver.Path.weightOfEPs`: A convenience version of `weight` where the weight of an edge
  is determined by a function of its source and target vertices.

## Main results

* `Quiver.Path.weight_comp`: The weight of a composition of paths is the product of their weights.
* `Quiver.Path.weight_pos`: If all edge weights are positive, the path weight is positive.
* `Quiver.Path.weightOfEPs_nonneg`: If all edge weights are non-negative, so is the path weight.
