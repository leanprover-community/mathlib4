# Partitions

A partition of a natural number `n` is a way of writing `n` as a sum of positive integers, where the
order does not matter: two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the
same partition. This notion is closely related to that of a composition of `n`, but in a composition
of `n` the order does matter.
A summand of the partition is called a part.

## Main functions

* `p : Partition n` is a structure, made of a multiset of integers which are all positive and
  add up to `n`.

## Implementation details

The main motivation for this structure and its API is to show Euler's partition theorem, and
related results.

The representation of a partition as a multiset is very handy as multisets are very flexible and
already have a well-developed API.
