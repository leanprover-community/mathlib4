## Main definitions and results

* `MulAction (Equiv.Perm X) (X → Y)`: action of permutations on colorings by precomposition.
* `coloringEquiv`: two colorings are equivalent if they lie in the same orbit.
* `coloringEquiv_equivalence`: this defines an equivalence relation.
* `orbit_size_eq_index`: the orbit–stabilizer theorem reformulated for colorings.

## Implementation notes

We model a coloring as a function `X → Y`, where `X` is a finite set of objects
and `Y` is a finite set of colors.
The permutation group `Equiv.Perm X` acts on colorings by precomposition.

A *coloring* is a function `X → Y`.
The permutation group `Equiv.Perm X` acts on colorings by precomposition:
`(g • c) x = c (g⁻¹ x)`.

For permutations `f, g : Equiv.Perm X`, the colorings `g • c` and `f • c`
are equal if and only if `f⁻¹ * g` belongs to the stabilizer of `c`.
