# Compositions

A composition of a natural number `n` is a decomposition `n = i₀ + ... + i_{k-1}` of `n` into a sum
of positive integers. Combinatorially, it corresponds to a decomposition of `{0, ..., n-1}` into
non-empty blocks of consecutive integers, where the `iⱼ` are the lengths of the blocks.
This notion is closely related to that of a partition of `n`, but in a composition of `n` the
order of the `iⱼ`s matters.

We implement two different structures covering these two viewpoints on compositions. The first
one, made of a list of positive integers summing to `n`, is the main one and is called
`Composition n`. The second one is useful for combinatorial arguments (for instance to show that
the number of compositions of `n` is `2^(n-1)`). It is given by a subset of `{0, ..., n}`
containing `0` and `n`, where the elements of the subset (other than `n`) correspond to the leftmost
points of each block. The main API is built on `Composition n`, and we provide an equivalence
between the two types.

## Main functions

* `c : Composition n` is a structure, made of a list of integers which are all positive and
  add up to `n`.
* `composition_card` states that the cardinality of `Composition n` is exactly
  `2^(n-1)`, which is proved by constructing an equiv with `CompositionAsSet n` (see below), which
  is itself in bijection with the subsets of `Fin (n-1)` (this holds even for `n = 0`, where `-` is
  nat subtraction).

Let `c : Composition n` be a composition of `n`. Then
* `c.blocks` is the list of blocks in `c`.
* `c.length` is the number of blocks in the composition.
* `c.blocksFun : Fin c.length → ℕ` is the realization of `c.blocks` as a function on
  `Fin c.length`. This is the main object when using compositions to understand the composition of
    analytic functions.
* `c.sizeUpTo : ℕ → ℕ` is the sum of the size of the blocks up to `i`.;
* `c.embedding i : Fin (c.blocksFun i) → Fin n` is the increasing embedding of the `i`-th block in
  `Fin n`;
* `c.index j`, for `j : Fin n`, is the index of the block containing `j`.

* `Composition.ones n` is the composition of `n` made of ones, i.e., `[1, ..., 1]`.
* `Composition.single n (hn : 0 < n)` is the composition of `n` made of a single block of size `n`.

Compositions can also be used to split lists. Let `l` be a list of length `n` and `c` a composition
of `n`.
* `l.splitWrtComposition c` is a list of lists, made of the slices of `l` corresponding to the
  blocks of `c`.
* `join_splitWrtComposition` states that splitting a list and then joining it gives back the
  original list.
* `joinSplitWrtComposition_join` states that joining a list of lists, and then splitting it back
  according to the right composition, gives back the original list of lists.

We turn to the second viewpoint on compositions, that we realize as a finset of `Fin (n+1)`.
`c : CompositionAsSet n` is a structure made of a finset of `Fin (n+1)` called `c.boundaries`
and proofs that it contains `0` and `n`. (Taking a finset of `Fin n` containing `0` would not
make sense in the edge case `n = 0`, while the previous description works in all cases).
The elements of this set (other than `n`) correspond to leftmost points of blocks.
Thus, there is an equiv between `Composition n` and `CompositionAsSet n`. We
only construct basic API on `CompositionAsSet` (notably `c.length` and `c.blocks`) to be able
to construct this equiv, called `compositionEquiv n`. Since there is a straightforward equiv
between `CompositionAsSet n` and finsets of `{1, ..., n-1}` (obtained by removing `0` and `n`
from a `CompositionAsSet` and called `compositionAsSetEquiv n`), we deduce that
`CompositionAsSet n` and `Composition n` are both fintypes of cardinality `2^(n - 1)`
(see `compositionAsSet_card` and `composition_card`).

## Implementation details

The main motivation for this structure and its API is in the construction of the composition of
formal multilinear series, and the proof that the composition of analytic functions is analytic.

The representation of a composition as a list is very handy as lists are very flexible and already
have a well-developed API.

### Splitting a list

Given a list of length `n` and a composition `c` of `n`, one can split `l` into `c.length` sublists
of respective lengths `c.blocksFun 0`, ..., `c.blocksFun (c.length-1)`. This is inverse to the
join operation.
