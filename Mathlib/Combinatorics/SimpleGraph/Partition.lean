# Graph partitions

This module provides an interface for dealing with partitions on simple graphs. A partition of
a graph `G`, with vertices `V`, is a set `P` of disjoint nonempty subsets of `V` such that:

* The union of the subsets in `P` is `V`.

* Each element of `P` is an independent set. (Each subset contains no pair of adjacent vertices.)

Graph partitions are graph colorings that do not name their colors.  They are adjoint in the
following sense. Given a graph coloring, there is an associated partition from the set of color
classes, and given a partition, there is an associated graph coloring from using the partition's
subsets as colors.  Going from graph colorings to partitions and back makes a coloring "canonical":
all colors are given a canonical name and unused colors are removed.  Going from partitions to
graph colorings and back is the identity.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.Partition` is a structure to represent a partition of a simple graph

* `SimpleGraph.Partition.PartsCardLe` is whether a given partition is an `n`-partition.
  (a partition with at most `n` parts).

* `SimpleGraph.Partitionable n` is whether a given graph is `n`-partite

* `SimpleGraph.Partition.toColoring` creates colorings from partitions

* `SimpleGraph.Coloring.toPartition` creates partitions from colorings

## Main statements

* `SimpleGraph.partitionable_iff_colorable` is that `n`-partitionability and
  `n`-colorability are equivalent.
