# Coset graphs (Sabidussi construction)

Given a group `G`, a subgroup `H`, and a *connection set* `D ⊆ G` that is a union of
`(H, H)`-double cosets, is symmetric (`D = D⁻¹`), and is disjoint from `H`, we define the
**coset graph** `Sab(G, H, D)` whose vertices are the left cosets `G ⧸ H` and whose edges
connect `xH` to `yH` whenever `x⁻¹y ∈ D`.

This is Sabidussi's generalization of Cayley graphs: when `H = ⊥`, the coset graph on
`G ⧸ ⊥ ≃ G` recovers the Cayley graph `Cay(G, D)`.

## Main definitions

* `IsConnectionSet H D` — `D` is a union of `(H, H)`-double cosets, closed under inversion,
  and disjoint from `H`
* `SimpleGraph.cosetGraph H D` — the coset graph `Sab(G, H, D)` as a `SimpleGraph (G ⧸ H)`

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.cosetGraph.adj_mk` — adjacency is characterized by `x⁻¹y ∈ D`
* `SimpleGraph.cosetGraph.graphAction` — `G` acts on the coset graph preserving adjacency
* `SimpleGraph.cosetGraph.isVertexTransitive` — coset graphs are vertex-transitive
