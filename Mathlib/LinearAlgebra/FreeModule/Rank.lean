# Extra results about `Module.rank`

This file contains some extra results not in `LinearAlgebra.Dimension`.

It also contains a proof of the Erd≈ës-Kaplansky theorem (`rank_dual_eq_card_dual_of_aleph0_le_rank`)
which says that the dimension of an infinite-dimensional dual space over a division ring
has dimension equal to its cardinality.
