# Root data and root systems

This file contains basic definitions for root systems and root data.

## Main definitions:

 * `RootPairing`: Given two perfectly-paired `R`-modules `M` and `N` (over some commutative ring
   `R`) a root pairing with indexing set `ι` is the data of an `ι`-indexed subset of `M`
   ("the roots") and an `ι`-indexed subset of `N` ("the coroots") satisfying the axioms familiar
   from the traditional theory of root systems / data.
 * `RootDatum`: A root datum is a root pairing for which the roots and coroots take values in
   finitely-generated free Abelian groups.
 * `RootSystem`: A root system is a root pairing for which the roots span their ambient module.
 * `RootPairing.IsCrystallographic`: A root pairing is said to be crystallographic if the pairing
   between a root and coroot is always an integer.
 * `RootPairing.IsReduced`: A root pairing is said to be reduced if it never contains the double of
   a root.

## Todo

* Introduce the Weyl Group
* Coxeter weights of pairs
* Properties of pairs of roots, e.g., parallel, ultraparallel, definite, orthogonal, imaginary,
non-symmetrizable

## Implementation details

A root datum is sometimes defined as two subsets: roots and coroots, together with a bijection
between them, subject to hypotheses. However the hypotheses ensure that the bijection is unique and
so the question arises of whether this bijection should be part of the data of a root datum or
whether one should merely assert its existence. For root systems, things are even more extreme: the
coroots are uniquely determined by the roots. Furthermore a root system induces a canonical
non-degenerate bilinear form on the ambient space and many informal accounts even include this form
as part of the data.

We have opted for a design in which some of the uniquely-determined data is included: the bijection
between roots and coroots is (implicitly) included and the coroots are included for root systems.
Empirically this seems to be by far the most convenient design and by providing extensionality
lemmas expressing the uniqueness we expect to get the best of both worlds.

A final point is that we require roots and coroots to be injections from a base indexing type `ι`
rather than subsets of their codomains. This design was chosen to avoid the bijection between roots
and coroots being a dependently-typed object. A third option would be to have the roots and coroots
be subsets but to avoid having a dependently-typed bijection by defining it globally with junk value
`0` outside of the roots and coroots. This would work but lacks the convenient symmetry that the
chosen design enjoys: by introducing the indexing type `ι`, one does not have to pick a direction
(`roots → coroots` or `coroots → roots`) for the forward direction of the bijection. Besides,
providing the user with the additional definitional power to specify an indexing type `ι` is a
benefit and the junk-value pattern is a cost.
