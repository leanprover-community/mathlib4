# Linear programming

We define linear programs over a `LinearOrderedField K` in the standard matrix form.

## Main definitions

 * `StandardLP` defines a linear program in the standard form $ \max cᵀx, A x ≤ b, x ≥ 0 $.
 * `StandardLP.IsSolution` tells if given vector is a solution satisfying given standard LP.
 * `StandardLP.IsFeasible` tells if given standard LP has any solution.
 * `StandardLP.Reaches` tells if given value can be obtained as a cost of any solution of given
    standard LP.
 * `StandardLP.dual` defines a dual problem to given standard LP.

## Main results

* `StandardLP.weakDuality`: The weak duality theorem (`cᵀx` such that `A x ≤ b` and `x ≥ 0` is
   always less or equal to `bᵀy` such that `Aᵀ y ≥ c` and `y ≥ 0`).

multiplication by matrix `A` from the left yields a vector whose all entries are less or equal to
corresponding entries of the vector `b`. -/

when its entries are elementwise multiplied by the costs (given by the vector `c`) and summed up,
the result is the value `v`. -/

/-- Dual linear program to given linear program `P` in the standard form.
The matrix gets transposed and its values flip signs.
The original cost function gets flipped signs as well and becomes the new righ-hand side vector.
The original righ-hand side vector becomes the new vector of objective function coefficients. -/
