# Orthogonal

This file contains definitions and properties concerning orthogonality of rows and columns.

## Main results

- `matrix.HasOrthogonalRows`:
  `A.HasOrthogonalRows` means `A` has orthogonal (with respect to `dotProduct`) rows.
- `matrix.HasOrthogonalCols`:
  `A.HasOrthogonalCols` means `A` has orthogonal (with respect to `dotProduct`) columns.
