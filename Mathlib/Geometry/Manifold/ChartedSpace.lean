# Charted spaces

A smooth manifold is a topological space `M` locally modelled on a Euclidean space (or a Euclidean
half-space for manifolds with boundaries, or an infinite-dimensional vector space for more general
notions of manifolds), i.e., the manifold is covered by open subsets on which there are local
homeomorphisms (the charts) going to a model space `H`, and the changes of charts should be smooth
maps.

In this file, we introduce a general framework describing these notions, where the model space is an
arbitrary topological space. We avoid the word *manifold*, which should be reserved for the
situation where the model space is a (subset of a) vector space, and use the terminology
*charted space* instead.

If the changes of charts satisfy some additional property (for instance if they are smooth), then
`M` inherits additional structure (it makes sense to talk about smooth manifolds). There are
therefore two different ingredients in a charted space:
* the set of charts, which is data
* the fact that changes of charts belong to some group (in fact groupoid), which is additional Prop.

We separate these two parts in the definition: the charted space structure is just the set of
charts, and then the different smoothness requirements (smooth manifold, orientable manifold,
contact manifold, and so on) are additional properties of these charts. These properties are
formalized through the notion of structure groupoid, i.e., a set of open partial homeomorphisms
stable under composition and inverse, to which the change of coordinates should belong.

## Main definitions

* `StructureGroupoid H` : a subset of open partial homeomorphisms of `H` stable under composition,
  inverse and restriction (ex: partial diffeomorphisms).
* `continuousGroupoid H` : the groupoid of all open partial homeomorphisms of `H`.
* `ChartedSpace H M` : charted space structure on `M` modelled on `H`, given by an atlas of
  open partial homeomorphisms from `M` to `H` whose sources cover `M`. This is a type class.
* `HasGroupoid M G` : when `G` is a structure groupoid on `H` and `M` is a charted space
  modelled on `H`, require that all coordinate changes belong to `G`. This is a type class.
* `atlas H M` : when `M` is a charted space modelled on `H`, the atlas of this charted
  space structure, i.e., the set of charts.
* `G.maximalAtlas M` : when `M` is a charted space modelled on `H` and admitting `G` as a
  structure groupoid, one can consider all the open partial homeomorphisms from `M` to `H` such that
  changing coordinate from any chart to them belongs to `G`. This is a larger atlas, called the
  maximal atlas (for the groupoid `G`).
* `Structomorph G M M'` : the type of diffeomorphisms between the charted spaces `M` and `M'` for
  the groupoid `G`. We avoid the word diffeomorphism, keeping it for the smooth category.

As a basic example, we give the instance
`instance chartedSpaceSelf (H : Type*) [TopologicalSpace H] : ChartedSpace H H`
saying that a topological space is a charted space over itself, with the identity as unique chart.
This charted space structure is compatible with any groupoid.

Additional useful definitions:

* `Pregroupoid H` : a subset of partial maps of `H` stable under composition and
  restriction, but not inverse (ex: smooth maps)
* `Pregroupoid.groupoid` : construct a groupoid from a pregroupoid, by requiring that a map and
  its inverse both belong to the pregroupoid (ex: construct diffeos from smooth maps)
* `chartAt H x` is a preferred chart at `x : M` when `M` has a charted space structure modelled on
  `H`.
* `G.compatible he he'` states that, for any two charts `e` and `e'` in the atlas, the composition
  of `e.symm` and `e'` belongs to the groupoid `G` when `M` admits `G` as a structure groupoid.
* `G.compatible_of_mem_maximalAtlas he he'` states that, for any two charts `e` and `e'` in the
  maximal atlas associated to the groupoid `G`, the composition of `e.symm` and `e'` belongs to the
  `G` if `M` admits `G` as a structure groupoid.
* `ChartedSpaceCore.toChartedSpace`: consider a space without a topology, but endowed with a set
  of charts (which are partial equivs) for which the change of coordinates are partial homeos.
  Then one can construct a topology on the space for which the charts become partial homeos,
  defining a genuine charted space structure.

## Implementation notes

The atlas in a charted space is *not* a maximal atlas in general: the notion of maximality depends
on the groupoid one considers, and changing groupoids changes the maximal atlas. With the current
formalization, it makes sense first to choose the atlas, and then to ask whether this precise atlas
defines a smooth manifold, an orientable manifold, and so on. A consequence is that structomorphisms
between `M` and `M'` do *not* induce a bijection between the atlases of `M` and `M'`: the
definition is only that, read in charts, the structomorphism locally belongs to the groupoid under
consideration. (This is equivalent to inducing a bijection between elements of the maximal atlas).
A consequence is that the invariance under structomorphisms of properties defined in terms of the
atlas is not obvious in general, and could require some work in theory (amounting to the fact
that these properties only depend on the maximal atlas, for instance). In practice, this does not
create any real difficulty.

We use the letter `H` for the model space thinking of the case of manifolds with boundary, where the
model space is a half space.

Manifolds are sometimes defined as topological spaces with an atlas of local diffeomorphisms, and
sometimes as spaces with an atlas from which a topology is deduced. We use the former approach:
otherwise, there would be an instance from manifolds to topological spaces, which means that any
instance search for topological spaces would try to find manifold structures involving a yet
unknown model space, leading to problems. However, we also introduce the latter approach,
through a structure `ChartedSpaceCore` making it possible to construct a topology out of a set of
partial equivs with compatibility conditions (but we do not register it as an instance).

In the definition of a charted space, the model space is written as an explicit parameter as there
can be several model spaces for a given topological space. For instance, a complex manifold
(modelled over `ℂ^n`) will also be seen sometimes as a real manifold modelled over `ℝ^(2n)`.

## Notation

In the scope `Manifold`, we denote the composition of open partial homeomorphisms with `≫ₕ`, and the
composition of partial equivs with `≫`.

/-! ### Structure groupoids -/

section Groupoid

/-! One could add to the definition of a structure groupoid the fact that the restriction of an
element of the groupoid to any open set still belongs to the groupoid.
(This is in Kobayashi-Nomizu.)
I am not sure I want this, for instance on `H × E` where `E` is a vector space, and the groupoid is
made of functions respecting the fibers and linear in the fibers (so that a charted space over this
groupoid is naturally a vector bundle) I prefer that the members of the groupoid are always
defined on sets of the form `s × E`. There is a typeclass `ClosedUnderRestriction` for groupoids
which have the restriction property.

The only nontrivial requirement is locality: if an open partial homeomorphism belongs to the
groupoid around each point in its domain of definition, then it belongs to the groupoid. Without
this requirement, the composition of structomorphisms does not have to be a structomorphism. Note
that this implies that an open partial homeomorphism with empty source belongs to any structure
groupoid, as it trivially satisfies this condition.

There is also a technical point, related to the fact that an open partial homeomorphism is by
definition a global map which is a homeomorphism when restricted to its source subset (and its
values outside of the source are not relevant). Therefore, we also require that being a member of
the groupoid only depends on the values on the source.

We use primes in the structure names as we will reformulate them below (without primes) using a
`Membership` instance, writing `e ∈ G` instead of `e ∈ G.members`.

/-! ### Charted spaces -/

/-- A charted space is a topological space endowed with an atlas, i.e., a set of local
homeomorphisms taking value in a model space `H`, called charts, such that the domains of the charts
cover the whole space. We express the covering property by choosing for each `x` a member
`chartAt x` of the atlas containing `x` in its source: in the smooth case, this is convenient to
construct the tangent bundle in an efficient way.
The model space is written as an explicit parameter as there can be several model spaces for a
given topological space. For instance, a complex manifold (modelled over `ℂ^n`) will also be seen
sometimes as a real manifold over `ℝ^(2n)`.

section Products

library_note2 «Manifold type tags» /-- For technical reasons we introduce two type tags:

* `ModelProd H H'` is the same as `H × H'`;
* `ModelPi H` is the same as `∀ i, H i`, where `H : ι → Type*` and `ι` is a finite type.

In both cases the reason is the same, so we explain it only in the case of the product. A charted
space `M` with model `H` is a set of charts from `M` to `H` covering the space. Every space is
registered as a charted space over itself, using the only chart `id`, in `chartedSpaceSelf`. You
can also define a product of charted space `M` and `M'` (with model space `H × H'`) by taking the
products of the charts. Now, on `H × H'`, there are two charted space structures with model space
`H × H'` itself, the one coming from `chartedSpaceSelf`, and the one coming from the product of
the two `chartedSpaceSelf` on each component. They are equal, but not defeq (because the product
of `id` and `id` is not defeq to `id`), which is bad as we know. This expedient of renaming `H × H'`
solves this problem. -/
