/-! # Holomorphic functions on complex manifolds

Thanks to the rigidity of complex-differentiability compared to real-differentiability, there are
many results about complex manifolds with no analogue for manifolds over a general normed field. For
now, this file contains just two (closely related) such results:

## Main results

* `mdifferentiable.is_locally_constant`: A complex-differentiable function on a compact complex
  manifold is locally constant.
* `mdifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compact_space`: A complex-differentiable function on a compact
  preconnected complex manifold is constant.

## TODO

There is a whole theory to develop here.  Maybe a next step would be to develop a theory of
holomorphic vector/line bundles, including:
* the finite-dimensionality of the space of sections of a holomorphic vector bundle
* Siegel's theorem: for any `n + 1` formal ratios `g 0 / h 0`, `g 1 / h 1`, .... `g n / h n` of
  sections of a fixed line bundle `L` over a complex `n`-manifold, there exists a polynomial
  relationship `P (g 0 / h 0, g 1 / h 1, .... g n / h n) = 0`

Another direction would be to develop the relationship with sheaf theory, building the sheaves of
holomorphic and meromorphic functions on a complex manifold and proving algebraic results about the
stalks, such as the Weierstrass preparation theorem.
