/-! # Smooth immersions and embeddings

In this file, we define `C^n` immersions and embeddings between `C^n` manifolds.
The correct definition in the infinite-dimensional setting differs from the standard
finite-dimensional definition (concerning the `mfderiv` being injective): future pull requests will
prove that our definition implies the latter, and that both are equivalent for finite-dimensional
manifolds.

This definition can be conveniently formulated in terms of local properties: `f` is an immersion at
`x` iff there exist suitable charts near `x` and `f x` such that `f` has a nice form w.r.t. these
charts. Most results below can be deduced from more abstract results about such local properties.
This shortens the overall argument, as the definition of submersions has the same general form.

## Main definitions
* `IsImmersionAt F I J n f x` means a map `f : M → N` between `C^n` manifolds `M` and `N`
  is an immersion at `x : M`: there are charts `φ` and `ψ` of `M` and `N` around `x` and `f x`,
  respectively, such that in these charts, `f` looks like `u ↦ (u, 0)`, w.r.t. some equivalence
  `E' ≃L[𝕜] E × F`. We do not demand that `f` be differentiable (this follows from this definition).
* `IsImmersion F I J n f` means `f : M → N` is an immersion at every point `x : M`.

## Main results
* `IsImmersionAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq`: being an immersion is a local property.
  If `f` and `g` agree near `x` and `f` is an immersion at `x`, so is `g`

## TODO
* Show `IsImmersion(At)` is stable under replacing `F` by an isomorphic copy.
* The set where `LiftSourceTargetPropertyAt` holds is open.
* `IsImmersionAt.contMDiffAt`: if f is an immersion at `x`, it is `C^n` at `x`.
* `IsImmersion.contMDiff`: if f is an immersion, it is `C^n`.
* `IsImmersionAt.prodMap`: the product of two immersions is an immersion
* If `f` is an immersion at `x`, its differential splits, hence is injective.
* If `f : M → N` is a map between Banach manifolds, `mfderiv I J f x` splitting implies `f` is an
  immersion at `x`. (This requires the inverse function theorem.)
* `IsImmersionAt.comp`: if `f : M → N` and `g: N → N'` are maps between Banach manifolds such that
  `f` is an immersion at `x : M` and `g` is an immersion at `f x`, then `g ∘ f` is an immersion
  at `x`.
* `IsImmersion.comp`: the composition of immersions (between Banach manifolds) is an immersion
* If `f : M → N` is a map between finite-dimensional manifolds, `mfderiv I J f x` being injective
  implies `f` is an immersion at `x`.
* define smooth embeddings, and deduce analogous results for these

/--
If `f` is an immersion at `x`, it maps its domain chart's target to its codomain chart's target:
`(h.domChart.extend I).target` to `(h.domChart.extend J).target`.

Roig and Domingues' [roigdomingues1992] definition of immersions only asks for this inclusion
between the targets of the local charts: using mathlib's formalisation conventions, that condition
is *slightly* weaker than `source_subset_preimage_source`: the latter implies that
`h.codChart.extend J ∘ f` maps `h.domChart.source` to
`(h.codChart.extend J).target = (h.codChart.extend I) '' h.codChart.source`,
but that does *not* imply `f` maps `h.domChart.source` to `h.codChartSource`;
a priori `f` could map some point `f ∘ h.domChart.extend I x ∉ h.codChart.source` into the target.
Note that this difference only occurs because of our design using junk values;
this is not a mathematically meaningful difference.`

At the same time, this condition is fairly weak: it is implied, for instance, by `f` being
continuous at `x` (see `mk_of_continuousAt`), which is easy to ascertain in practice.
