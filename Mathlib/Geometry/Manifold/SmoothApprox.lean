# Approximation of continuous functions by smooth functions

In this file, we deduce from the existence of smooth partitions of unity that any continuous map
from a real σ-compact finite dimensional manifold `M` to a real normed space `F` can be
approximated uniformly by smooth functions.

More precisely, we strengthen this result in three ways :
* instead of a single number `ε > 0`, one may prescribe the precision of the approximation using
  an arbitrary continuous positive function `ε : M → ℝ`. This allows, for example, a control
  on the asymptotic behaviour of the approximation (e.g, choosing a precision `ε` which vanishes
  at infinity yields that continuous functions vanishing at infinity can be approximated by
  smooth functions vanishing at infinity).
* if the original map `f` already has the desired regularity on some neighborhood of a closed
  set `M`, one can choose an approximation which stays equal to `f` on `S`. This allows
  for some additional control in a setting with iterated approximations.
* finally, one may prescribe the approximation to vanish wherever the original function vanishes.
  For example, this shows that continuous functions supported on some compact set `K` may be
  approximated uniformly by smooth function supported on the **same** compact `K`.
  (Compare with arguments based on convolution where one needs to thicken `K` a bit).

## Main results

* `Continuous.exists_contMDiff_approx_and_eqOn`: approximating a continuous function `f : M → F`
  by a `C^n` function `g : M → E`, with precision prescribed by a continuous positive `ε : M → ℝ`,
  while ensuring that `support g ⊆ support f` and that `g` coincides with `f` on some closed set `S`
  in the neighborhood of which `f` is already `C^n`.
* `Continuous.exists_contMDiff_approx`: a simpler version of the previous result when one does not
  care about prescribing points with `g x = f x`. One still gets `support g ⊆ support f` for free,
  so we put it in the conclusion.
* `Continuous.exists_contDiff_approx_and_eqOn`, `Continuous.exists_contDiff_approx`: specializations
  of the previous results when `M = E` is a normed space.

## Implementation notes

With minor work, we could strengthen the statements in the following ways:
- the precision function `ε : M → ℝ` may be assumed `LowerSemicontinuous` instead of `Continuous`,
- the condition `support g ⊆ support f`, which translates to `∀ x, f x = 0 → g x = 0`,
  may be strengthened to `∀ x, f x = h x → g x = h x` for some arbitrary smooth `h : M → F`.

This file depends on the manifold library, which may be annoying if you only need the normed space
statements. **Please do not let this refrain you from using them** if they apply naturally in your
context: if this is too much of a problem, you should complain on Zulip, so that we get more data
about the need for a non-manifold version of `SmoothPartitionOfUnity`.

## TODO

- More generally, all results should apply to approximating continuous sections of a smooth
  vector bundle by smooth sections.
- If needed, specialize to `M = U` an open subset of a normed space `E`
  (we currently do `M = E` only).
