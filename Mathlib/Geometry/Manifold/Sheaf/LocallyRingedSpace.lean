/-! # Smooth manifolds as locally ringed spaces

This file equips a smooth manifold with the structure of a locally ringed space.

## Main results

* `smoothSheafCommRing.isUnit_stalk_iff`: The units of the stalk at `x` of the sheaf of smooth
  functions from a smooth manifold `M` to its scalar field `ùïú`, considered as a sheaf of commutative
  rings, are the functions whose values at `x` are nonzero.

## Main definitions

* `IsManifold.locallyRingedSpace`: A smooth manifold can be considered as a locally ringed space.

## TODO

Characterize morphisms-of-locally-ringed-spaces (`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom`) between
smooth manifolds.
