# Elaborators for differential geometry

This file defines custom elaborators for differential geometry to allow for more compact notation.
We introduce a class of elaborators for handling differentiability on manifolds, and the elaborator
`T%` for converting dependent sections of fibre bundles into non-dependent functions into the total
space.

All of these elaborators are scoped to the `Manifold` namespace.

## Differentiability on manifolds

We provide compact notation for differentiability and continuous differentiability on manifolds,
including inference of the model with corners.

| Notation            | Elaborates to                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `MDiff f`           | `MDifferentiable I J f`             |
| `MDiffAt f x`       | `MDifferentiableAt I J f x`         |
| `MDiff[u] f`        | `MDifferentiableOn I J f u`         |
| `MDiffAt[u] f x`    | `MDifferentiableWithinAt I J f u x` |
| `CMDiff n f`        | `ContMDiff I J n f`                 |
| `CMDiffAt n f x`    | `ContMDiffAt I J n f x`             |
| `CMDiff[u] n f`     | `ContMDiffOn I J n f u`             |
| `CMDiffAt[u] n f x` | `ContMDiffWithinAt I J n f u x`     |
| `mfderiv[u] f x`    | `mfderivWithin I J f u x`           |
| `mfderiv% f x`      | `mfderiv I J f x`                   |

In each of these cases, the models with corners are inferred from the domain and codomain of `f`.
The search for models with corners uses the local context and is (almost) only based on expression
structure, hence hopefully fast enough to always run.

This has no dedicated support for product manifolds (or product vector spaces) yet;
adding this is left for future changes. (It would need to make a choice between e.g. the
trivial model with corners on a product `E × F` and the product of the trivial models on `E` and
`F`). In these settings, the elaborators should be avoided (for now).

## `T%`

Secondly, this file adds an elaborator `T%` to ease working with sections in a fibre bundle,
which converts a section `s : Π x : M, V x` to a non-dependent function into the total space of the
bundle.
```lean
-- omitted: let `V` be a fibre bundle over `M`

variable {σ : Π x : M, V x} in
#check T% σ -- `(fun x ↦ TotalSpace.mk' F x (σ x)) : M → TotalSpace F V`

-- Note how the name of the bound variable `x` is preserved.
variable {σ : (x : E) → Trivial E E' x} in
#check T% σ -- `(fun x ↦ TotalSpace.mk' E' x (σ x)) : E → TotalSpace E' (Trivial E E')`

variable {s : E → E'} in
#check T% s -- `(fun a ↦ TotalSpace.mk' E' a (s a)) : E → TotalSpace E' (Trivial E E')`
```

---

These elaborators can be combined: `CMDiffAt[u] n (T% s) x`

**Warning.** These elaborators are a proof of concept; the implementation should be considered a
prototype. Don't rewrite all of mathlib to use it just yet. Notable limitations include
the following.

## TODO
- extend the elaborators to guess models with corners on product manifolds
  (this has to make a guess, hence cannot always be correct: but it could make the guess that
  is correct 90% of the time).
  For products of vector spaces `E × F`, this could print a warning about making a choice between
  the model in `E × F` and the product of the models on `E` and `F`.
- better error messages (as needed), with tests
- further testing and fixing of edge cases (with tests)
- add delaborators for these elaborators

Elaborator for sections in a fibre bundle: converts a section `s : Π x : M, V x` as a dependent
function to a non-dependent function into the total space. This handles the cases of
- sections of a trivial bundle
- vector fields on a manifold (i.e., sections of the tangent bundle)
- sections of an explicit fibre bundle
- turning a bare function `E → E'` into a section of the trivial bundle `Bundle.Trivial E E'`

This elaborator searches the local context for suitable hypotheses for the above cases by matching
on the expression structure, avoiding `isDefEq`. Therefore, it is (hopefully) fast enough to always
run.

/-- Try to find a `ModelWithCorners` instance on a type (represented by an expression `e`),
using the local context to infer the appropriate instance. This supports the following cases:
- the model with corners on the total space of a vector bundle
- the model with corners on the tangent space of a manifold
- a model with corners on a manifold, or on its underlying model space
- a closed interval of real numbers
- the trivial model `𝓘(𝕜, E)` on a normed space
- if the above are not found, try to find a `NontriviallyNormedField` instance on the type of `e`,
  and if successful, return `𝓘(𝕜)`.

Further cases can be added as necessary.

Return an expression describing the found model with corners.

`baseInfo` is only used for the first case, a model with corners on the total space of the vector
bundle. In this case, it contains a pair of expressions `(e, i)` describing the type of the base
and the model with corners on the base: these are required to construct the right model with
corners.

Note that the matching on `e` does not see through reducibility (e.g. we distinguish the `abbrev`
`TangentBundle` from its definition), so `whnfR` should not be run on `e` prior to calling
`findModel` on it.

This implementation is not maximally robust yet.

### Trace classes

Note that the overall `Elab` trace class does not inherit the trace classes defined in this
section, since they provide verbose information.
-/

/--
Trace class for differential geometry elaborators. Setting this to `true` traces elaboration
for the `T%` elaborator (`trace.Elab.DiffGeo.TotalSpaceMk`) and the family of `MDiff`-like
elaborators (`trace.Elab.DiffGeo.MDiff`).
-/
initialize registerTraceClass `Elab.DiffGeo

/--
Trace class for the `T%` elaborator, which converts a section of a vector bundle as a dependent
function to a non-dependent function into the total space.
-/
initialize registerTraceClass `Elab.DiffGeo.TotalSpaceMk (inherited := true)

/--
Trace class for the `MDiff` elaborator and friends, which infer a model with corners on the domain
(resp. codomain) of the map in question.
-/
initialize registerTraceClass `Elab.DiffGeo.MDiff (inherited := true)
