# Unoriented bordism theory

In this file, we sketch the beginnings of unoriented bordism theory.
This is not ready for mathlib yet (as we still need the instance that the boundary
of a manifold is a manifold again, might might need some hypotheses to be true).
-/

/-
Missing API for this to work nicely:
- boundary of manifolds: add a typeclass "HasNiceBoundary" (or so) which says
  the boundary is a manifold, and the inclusion is smooth (perhaps with demanding "dimension one less")
  The current definition of boundary and corners will not satisfy this, but many nice manifolds
  will. Prove that boundaryless manifolds are of this form, or so.
- add disjoint union of top. spaces and induced maps: mathlib has this in abstract nonsense form
- define the disjoint union of smooth manifolds, and the associated maps: show they are smooth
(perhaps prove as abstract nonsense? will see!)

- basic lemmas about boundary and interior
interior(M × N) = interior (M) × interior(N)
cor. The boundary of M × N is ∂M × N ∪ (M × ∂N)
cor. if M is boundaryless, ∂(M×N) = M × ∂N
cor. If M is a smooth manifold without boundary, M x I has boundary M× {0,1};
  this is diffeomorphic to M ⊔ M.

- then: complete definition of unoriented cobordisms; complete constructions I had
- fight DTT hell: why is the product with an interval not recognised?

- define the bordism relation/how to define the set of equivalence classes?
equivalences work nicely in the standard design... that's a "how to do X in Lean" question
- postponed: transitivity of the bordism relation (uses the collar neighbourhood theorem)

define induced maps between bordism groups (on singular n-manifolds is easy and done)
functoriality: what exactly do I have to show? also DTT question

prove some of the easy axioms of homology... perhaps all of it?
does mathlib have a class "extraordinary homology theory"? this could be an interesting instance...
