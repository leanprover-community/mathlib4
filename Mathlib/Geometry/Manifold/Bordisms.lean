# Unoriented bordism theory

In this file, we sketch the beginnings of unoriented bordism theory.
Not all of this might end up in mathlib already (depending on how many pre-requisites are missing),
but a fair number of pieces already can be upstreamed!

-/

/-
Missing API for this to work nicely:
- define the disjoint union of smooth manifolds, and the associated maps: show they are smooth
(perhaps prove as abstract nonsense? will see!)

- then: complete constructions of unoriented cobordisms
- fight DTT hell: why is the product with an interval not recognised?

- define the bordism relation/how to define the set of equivalence classes?
equivalences work nicely in the standard design... that's a "how to do X in Lean" question
- postponed: transitivity of the bordism relation (uses the collar neighbourhood theorem)

- define induced maps between bordism groups (on singular n-manifolds is easy and done)
- functoriality: what exactly do I have to show? also DTT question

- prove some of the easy axioms of homology... perhaps all of it?
- does mathlib have a typeclass for "extraordinary homology theory"?
  proving this is an instance could be interesting...

-- how to encode this in Lean?
-- Two singular `n`-manifolds are cobordant iff there exists a smooth cobordism between them.
-- The unoriented `n`-bordism group `Ω_n^O(X)` of `X` is the set of all equivalence classes
-- of singular n-manifolds up to bordism.
-- then: functor between these...

-- prove: every element in Ω_n^O(X) has order two
