## (Unoriented) bordism theory

This file defines the beginnings of (unoriented) bordism theory. For the full definition of
smooth oriented bordism groups, a number of prerequisites are missing from mathlib. However,
a significant amount of this work is already possible.

Currently, this file only contains the definition of *singular *n*-manifolds*:
bordism classes are the equivalence classes of singular n-manifolds w.r.t. the (co)bordism relation
and will be added in a future PR, as well as the definition of the (unoriented) bordism groups.

## Main definitions

- **SingularNManifold**: a singular `n`-manifold on a topological space `X`, for `n ∈ ℕ`, is a pair
  `(M, f)` of a closed `n`-dimensional smooth manifold `M` together with a continuous map `M → X`.
  We don't assume `M` to be modelled on `ℝ^n`, but add the model topological space `H`,
  the vector space `E` and the model with corners `I` as type parameters.
- `SingularNManifold.map`: a map `X → Y` of topological spaces induces a map between the spaces
  of singular n-manifolds
- `SingularNManifold.comap`: if `(N,f)` is a singular n-manifold on `X`
  and `φ: M → N` is continuous, the `comap` of `(N,f)` and `φ`
  is the induced singular n-manifold `(M, f ∘ φ)` on `X`.
- `SingularNManifold.empty`: the empty set `M`, viewed as an `n`-manifold,
  as a singular `n`-manifold over any space `X`.
- `SingularNManifold.toPUnit`: an `n`-dimensional manifold induces a singular `n`-manifold
  on the one-point space.
- `SingularNManifold.prod`: the product of a singular `n`-manifold and a singular `m`-manifold
  on the one-point space, is a singular `n+m`-manifold on the one-point space.
- `SingularNManifold.sum`: the disjoint union of two singular `n`-manifolds
  is a singular `n`-manifold.

## Implementation notes

To be written! Document the design decisions and why they were made.

## TODO
- define cobordisms and the cobordism relation
- prove that the cobordisms relation is an equivalence relation
- define unoriented bordisms groups (as a set of equivalence classes),
prove they are a group
- define relative bordism groups (generalising the previous three points)
- prove that relative unoriented bordism groups define an extraordinary homology theory

/-- A **singular `n`-manifold** on a topological space `X`, for `n ∈ ℕ`, is a pair `(M, f)`
of a closed `n`-dimensional `C^k` manifold `M` together with a continuous map `M → X`.
We assume that `M` is a manifold over the pair `(E, H)` with model `I`.

In practice, one commonly wants to take `k=∞` (as then e.g. the intersection form is a powerful tool
to compute bordism groups; for the definition, this makes no difference.) -/

/- The collar neighbourhood theorem: if `M` is a compact finite-dimensional manifold
with smooth boundary of co-dimension one,
there exist some `ε > 0` and a smooth embedding `[0, ε) × ∂M → M`, which maps `{0}×∂M` to `∂M`.

Proof outline.
(1) construct a normal vector field `X` in a neighbourhood of `∂M`, pointing inwards
(In a chart on Euclidean half-space, we can just take the unit vector in the first component.
 These can be combined using e.g. a partition of unity.)
(1') It might simplify the next steps to `X` to a smooth global vector field on `M`, say be zero.
(2) Since `∂M` is compact, there is an `ε` such that the flow of `X` is defined for time `ε`.
  (This is not *exactly* the same as ongoing work, but should follow from the same ideas.)
(3) Thus, the flow of `X` defines a map `[0, ε) × ∂M → M`
(4) Shrinking `ε` if needed, we can assume `φ` is a (topological) embedding.
  Since `∂M` is compact and `M` is Hausdorff, it suffices to show injectivity (and continuity).
  Each `x∈∂M` has a neighbourhood `U_x` where the vector field looks like a flow box
  (by construction), hence the flow is injective on `U_x` for some time `ε_x`.
  Cover `∂M` with finitely many such neighbourhoods, then `ε := min ε_i` is positive, and
  each flow line does not self-intersect until time `ε`.
  Suppose the map `φ` is not injective, then `φ(x, t)=φ(x', t')`. Say `x ∈ U_i` and `x' ∈ U_j`,
  then `x, x' ∉ U_i ∩ U_j` by hypothesis, and `x, x'` lie inside separated closed sets:
  these are some positive distance apart. Now continuity and compactness yields a lower bound
  `ε_ij` for each pair, on which there is no intersection. (a bit sketchy, but mostly works)
(5) `φ` is smooth, since solutions of smooth ODEs depend smoothly on their initial conditions
(6) `φ` is an immersion... that should be obvious

Steps (4) and (5) definitely use ongoing work of Winston Yin; I don't know if the flow of a vector
field is already defined.

  /- Outline of the proof:
    - using the collar neighbourhood theorem, choose matching collars for t in φ and ψ
      invert the first collar, to get a map (-ε, 0] × t.M → φ.W
    - let W be the attaching space, of φ.W and ψ.W along their common collar
      (i.e., we quotient the disjoint union φ.W ⊕ ψ.W along the identification by the collars)
    - the union of the collars defines an open neighbourhood of `t.M`:
      this is where the hypothesis `h` is used
    - the quotient is a smooth manifold: away from the boundary, the charts come from W and W';
      on the image of t.M, we define charts using the common map by the collars
      (smoothness is the tricky part: this requires the collars to *match*!)
    - prove: the inclusions of `φ.W` and `ψ.W` into this gluing are smooth
    - then, boundary data etc. are all easy to construct

  detail, this will be a larger project in itself. -/
