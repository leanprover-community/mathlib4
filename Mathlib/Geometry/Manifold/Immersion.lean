/-! # Smooth immersions

In this file, we define `C^n` immersions between `C^n` manifolds.
The correct definition in the infinite-dimensional setting differs from the standard
finite-dimensional definition (concerning the `mfderiv` being injective): future pull requests will
prove that our definition implies the latter, and that both are equivalent for finite-dimensional
manifolds.

This definition can be conveniently formulated in terms of local properties: `f` is an immersion at
`x` iff there exist suitable charts near `x` and `f x` such that `f` has a nice form w.r.t. these
charts. Most results below can be deduced from more abstract results about such local properties.
This shortens the overall argument, as the definition of submersions has the same general form.

## Main definitions

* `IsImmersionAtOfComplement F I J n f x` means a map `f : M → N` between `C^n` manifolds `M` and
  `N` is an immersion at `x : M`: there are charts `φ` and `ψ` of `M` and `N` around `x` and `f x`,
  respectively, such that in these charts, `f` looks like `u ↦ (u, 0)`, w.r.t. some equivalence
  `E' ≃L[𝕜] E × F`. We do not demand that `f` be differentiable (this follows from this definition).
* `IsImmersionAt I J n f x` means that `f` is a `C^n` immersion at `x : M` for some choice of a
  complement `F` of the model normed space `E` of `M` in the model normed space `E'` of `N`.
  In most cases, prefer this definition over `IsImmersionAtOfComplement`.
* `IsImmersionOfComplement F I J n f` means `f : M → N` is an immersion at every point `x : M`,
  w.r.t. the chosen complement `F`.
* `IsImmersion I J n f` means `f : M → N` is an immersion at every point `x : M`,
  w.r.t. some global choice of complement.

## Main results

* `IsImmersionAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq`: being an immersion is a local property.
  If `f` and `g` agree near `x` and `f` is an immersion at `x`, so is `g`
* `IsImmersionAtOfComplement.congr_F`, `IsImmersionOfComplement.congr_F`:
  being an immersion (at `x`) w.r.t. `F` is stable under
  replacing the complement `F` by an isomorphic copy
* `IsOpen.isImmersionAtOfComplement` and `IsOpen.isImmersionAt`:
  the set of points where `IsImmersionAt(OfComplement)` holds is open.
* `IsImmersionAt.prodMap` and `IsImmersion.prodMap`: the product of two immersions (at a point)
  is an immersion (at a point).
* `IsImmersion.id`: the identity map is an immersion
* `IsImmersion.of_opens`: the inclusion of an open subset `s → M` of a smooth manifold
  is a smooth immersion
* `IsImmersionAt.contMDiffAt`: if f is an immersion at `x`, it is `C^n` at `x`.
* `IsImmersion.contMDiff`: if f is a `C^n` immersion, it is automatically `C^n`
  in the sense of `ContMDiff`..

## Implementation notes

* In most applications, there is no need to control the chosen complement in the definition of
  immersions, so `IsImmersion(At)` is perfectly fine to use. Such control will be helpful, however,
  when considering the local characterisation of submanifolds: locally, a submanifold is described
  either as the image of an immersion, or the preimage of a submersion --- w.r.t. the same
  complement. Having access to a definition version with complements allows stating this equivalence
  cleanly.
* To avoid a free universe variable in `IsImmersion(At)`, we ask for a complement in the same
  universe as the model normed space for `N`. We provide convenience constructors which do not
  have this restriction (recovering usability).
  The underlying observation is that the equivalence in the definition of immersions allows
  shrinking the universe of the complement: this is implemented in
  `IsImmersion(At)OfComplement.small` and `IsImmersion(At)OfComplement.smallEquiv`.

## TODO
* The converse to `IsImmersionAtOfComplement.congr_F` also holds: any two complements are
  isomorphic, as they are isomorphic to the cokernel of the differential `mfderiv I J f x`.
* If `f` is an immersion at `x`, its differential splits, hence is injective.
* If `f : M → N` is a map between Banach manifolds, `mfderiv I J f x` splitting implies `f` is an
  immersion at `x`. (This requires the inverse function theorem.)
* `IsImmersionAt.comp`: if `f : M → N` and `g: N → N'` are maps between Banach manifolds such that
  `f` is an immersion at `x : M` and `g` is an immersion at `f x`, then `g ∘ f` is an immersion
  at `x`.
* `IsImmersion.comp`: the composition of immersions (between Banach manifolds) is an immersion
* If `f : M → N` is a map between finite-dimensional manifolds, `mfderiv I J f x` being injective
  implies `f` is an immersion at `x`.
* `IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.isImmersionAt` and `IsLocalDiffeomorph.isImmersion`:
  a local diffeomorphism (at `x`) is an immersion (at `x`)
* `Diffeomorph.isImmersion`: in particular, a diffeomorphism is an immersion

in some settings, such as proving that embedded submanifolds are locally given either by an
immersion or a submersion.

If `f` is an immersion at `x`, it maps its domain chart's target `(h.domChart.extend I).target`
to its codomain chart's target `(h.domChart.extend J).target`.

Roig and Domingues' [roigdomingues1992] definition of immersions only asks for this inclusion
between the targets of the local charts: using mathlib's formalisation conventions, that condition
is *slightly* weaker than `source_subset_preimage_source`: the latter implies that
`h.codChart.extend J ∘ f` maps `h.domChart.source` to
`(h.codChart.extend J).target = (h.codChart.extend I) '' h.codChart.source`,
but that does *not* imply `f` maps `h.domChart.source` to `h.codChart.source`;
a priori `f` could map some point `f ∘ h.domChart.extend I x ∉ h.codChart.source` into the target.
Note that this difference only occurs because of our design using junk values;
this is not a mathematically meaningful difference.

At the same time, this condition is fairly weak: it is implied, for instance, by `f` being
continuous at `x` (see `mk_of_continuousAt`), which is easy to ascertain in practice.

See `target_subset_preimage_target` for a version stated using preimages instead of images.

If `f` is an immersion at `x`, it maps its domain chart's target to its codomain chart's target:
`(h.domChart.extend I).target` to `(h.domChart.extend J).target`.

Roig and Domingues' [roigdomingues1992] definition of immersions only asks for this inclusion
between the targets of the local charts: using mathlib's formalisation conventions, that condition
is *slightly* weaker than `source_subset_preimage_source`: the latter implies that
`h.codChart.extend J ∘ f` maps `h.domChart.source` to
`(h.codChart.extend J).target = (h.codChart.extend I) '' h.codChart.source`,
but that does *not* imply `f` maps `h.domChart.source` to `h.codChart.source`;
a priori `f` could map some point `f ∘ h.domChart.extend I x ∉ h.codChart.source` into the target.
Note that this difference only occurs because of our design using junk values;
this is not a mathematically meaningful difference.

At the same time, this condition is fairly weak: it is implied, for instance, by `f` being
continuous at `x` (see `mk_of_continuousAt`), which is easy to ascertain in practice.

See `target_subset_preimage_target` for a version stated using preimages instead of images.

Implicit in this definition is an abstract choice `F` of a complement of `E` in `E'`:

use `IsImmersionOfComplement` instead.

Note that our global choice of complement is a bit stronger than asking `f` to be an immersion at

Note that the converse statement is false in general:
if `f` is an immersion at each `x`, but with the choice of complement possibly depending on `x`,
there need not be a global choice of complement for which `f` is an immersion at each point.
The complement of `f` at `x` is isomorphic to the cokernel of `mfderiv I J f x`, but the `mfderiv`
of `f` at (even nearby) points `x` and `x'` are not directly related. They have the same rank
(the dimension of `E`, as will follow from injectivity), but if `E''` is infinite-dimensional this
is not conclusive. If `E''` is infinite-dimensional, this dimension can indeed change between
