# Polygons

This subfolder contains the theory of polygons and simple polygons in Euclidean space. It takes the Jordan Curve Theorem as an axiom when dealing with simple Euclidean polygons.

## Topics

The topics currently covered are:

* Basic polygon definitions (vertices, edges, boundary)
* Simple polygons (non-self-intersecting polygons)
* Boundary parameterization and its properties (continuity, injectivity)
* Simple closed curves and the Jordan Curve Theorem
* Jordan decomposition of simple polygon boundaries

## Files

* `Basic.lean`: Fundamental polygon definitions applicable to any module over ℝ
* `SimpleEuclideanPolygon.lean`: Simple polygons in 2D Euclidean space and Jordan curve theory
