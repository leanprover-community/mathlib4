# Algebraic theory of convex cones

This subfolder is destined to contain results about convex cones that do not require a topology,
a norm nor an inner product.

See the `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Cone` folder for the topological results.

## Topics

The convex cone topics currently covered are:
* Convex cones
* Pointed cones
