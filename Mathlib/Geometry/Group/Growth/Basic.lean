# Growth function of a finitely generated group

The growth of a group `G` with respect to a generating family `P` is the function sending `n` to
the number of elements of word length at most `n`.

## Main definitions

* `Group.Generators.wordBall`: the closed ball of radius `n` in the word metric.
* `Group.Generators.growth`: the growth function `n ↦ #(wordBall n)`.

## Implementation notes

* `wordBall` is defined via `wordLength`, so it is compatible with the existing word metric API.
* When the index type is finite, `wordBall n` is a finite set, hence `growth n` is the actual
  cardinality.
