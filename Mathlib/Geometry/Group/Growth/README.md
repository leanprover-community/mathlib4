# Growth of groups

This subfolder is destined to contain results about the growth of groups.

If $G$ is a finitely generated group, say $G = \langle S\rangle$ for some finite symmetric set $S$, then the growth of $G$ is defined to be the function $n \mapsto |S^n|$ where $S^n$ denotes pointwise multiplication of $n$ copies of $S$. Up to scaling, the growth does not depend on the symmetric generating set $S$.

## Topics

The results on growth of groups currently covered are:
* The growth of a group is at least linear
* The growth of a group $G$ is roughly the growth of a normal subgroup $H \le G$ times the growth of $G / H$.
