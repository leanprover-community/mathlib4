# Coinduced representations

Given a commutative ring `k`, a monoid homomorphism `φ : G →* H`, and a `k`-linear
`G`-representation `A`, this file introduces the coinduced representation $Coind_G^H(A)$ of `A` as
an `H`-representation.

By `coind φ A` we mean the submodule of functions `H → A` such that for all `g : G`, `h : H`,
`f (φ g * h) = ρ g (f h)`. We define a representation of `H` on this submodule by sending `h : H`
and `f : coind φ A` to the function `H → A` sending `h₁` to `f (h₁ * h)`.

Alternatively, we could define $Coind_G^H(A)$ as the morphisms $Hom(k[H], A)$ in the category
`Rep k G`, which we equip with the `H`-representation sending `h : H` and `f : k[H] ⟶ A` to the
representation morphism sending `r · h₁` to `r • f (h₁ * h)`. We include this definition as
`coind' φ A` and prove the two representations are isomorphic.

We also prove that the restriction functor `Rep k H ⥤ Rep k G` along `φ` is left adjoint to the
coinduction functor and hence that the coinduction functor preserves limits.

## Main definitions

* `Representation.coind φ ρ` : the coinduction of `ρ` along `φ` defined as the `k`-submodule of
  `G`-equivariant functions `H → A`, with `H`-action given by `(h • f) h₁ := f (h₁ * h)` for
  `f : H → A`, `h, h₁ : H`.
* `Representation.coind' φ A` : the coinduction of `A` along `φ` defined as the set of
  `G`-representation morphisms `k[H] ⟶ A`, with `H`-action given by
  `(h • f) (r • h₁) := r • f(h₁ * h)` for `f : k[H] ⟶ A`, `h, h₁ : H`, `r : k`.
* `Rep.resCoindAdjunction k φ`: given a monoid homomorphism `φ : G →* H`, this is the adjunction
  between the restriction functor `Rep k H ⥤ Rep k G` along `φ` and  the coinduction functor
  along `φ`.

If `ρ : Representation k G A` and `φ : G →* H` then `coind φ ρ` is the representation
coinduced by `ρ` along `φ`, defined as the following action of `H` on the submodule `coindV φ ρ`
of `G`-equivariant functions from `H` to `A`: we let `h : H` send the function `f : H → A`
to the function sending `h₁` to `f (h₁ * h)`.
