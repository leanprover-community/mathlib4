# Applications of Maschke's theorem

This proves some properties of representations that follow from Maschke's
theorem.

We prove that, if `G` is a finite group whose order is invertible in a field `k`,
then every object of `Rep k G` (resp. `FDRep k G`) is injective and projective.

We also give two simpleness criteria for an object `V` of `FDRep k G`, when `k` is
an algebraically closed field in which the order of `G` is invertible:
* `FDRep.simple_iff_end_is_rank_one`: `V` is simple if and only `V ⟶ V` is a `k`-vector
space of dimension `1`.
* `FDRep.simple_iff_char_is_norm_one`: when `k` is characteristic zero, `V` is simple
if and only if `∑ g : G, V.character g * V.character g⁻¹ = Fintype.card G`.
