# Shapiro's lemma for group homology

Given a commutative ring `k` and a subgroup `S ≤ G`, the file
`RepresentationTheory/Coinduced.lean` proves that the functor `Coind_S^G : Rep k S ⥤ Rep k G`
preserves epimorphisms. Since `Res(S) : Rep k G ⥤ Rep k S` is left adjoint to `Coind_S^G`, this
means `Res(S)` preserves projective objects. Since `Res(S)` is also exact, given a projective
resolution `P` of `k` as a trivial `k`-linear `G`-representation, `Res(S)(P)` is a projective
resolution of `k` as a trivial `k`-linear `S`-representation.

In `RepresentationTheory/Homological/GroupHomology/Induced.lean`, given a `G`-representation `X`,
we define a natural isomorphism between the functors `Rep k S ⥤ ModuleCat k` sending `A` to
`(Ind_S^G A ⊗ X)_G` and to `(A ⊗ Res(S)(X))_S`. Hence a projective resolution `P` of `k` as a
trivial `G`-representation induces an isomorphism of complexes
`(Ind_S^G A ⊗ P)_G ≅ (A ⊗ Res(S)(P))_S`, and since the homology of these complexes calculate
group homology, we conclude Shapiro's lemma: `Hₙ(G, Ind_S^G(A)) ≅ Hₙ(S, A)` for all `n`.
