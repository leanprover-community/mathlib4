# The group cohomology of a `k`-linear `G`-representation

Let `k` be a commutative ring and `G` a group. This file defines the group cohomology of
`A : Rep k G` to be the cohomology of the complex
$$0 \to \mathrm{Fun}(G^0, A) \to \mathrm{Fun}(G^1, A) \to \mathrm{Fun}(G^2, A) \to \dots$$
with differential $d^n$ sending $f: G^n \to A$ to the function mapping $(g_0, \dots, g_n)$ to
$$\rho(g_0)(f(g_1, \dots, g_n))$$
$$+ \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (-1)^{i + 1}\cdot f(g_0, \dots, g_ig_{i + 1}, \dots, g_n)$$
$$+ (-1)^{n + 1}\cdot f(g_0, \dots, g_{n - 1})$$ (where `ρ` is the representation attached to `A`).

We have a `k`-linear isomorphism
$\mathrm{Fun}(G^n, A) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(\bigoplus_{G^n} k[G], A)$, where
the righthand side is morphisms in `Rep k G`, and $k[G]$ is equipped with the left regular
representation. If we conjugate the $n$th differential in $\mathrm{Hom}(P, A)$ by this isomorphism,
where `P` is the bar resolution of `k` as a trivial `k`-linear `G`-representation, then the
resulting map agrees with the differential $d^n$ defined above, a fact we prove.

This gives us for free a proof that our $d^n$ squares to zero. It also gives us an isomorphism
$\mathrm{H}^n(G, A) \cong \mathrm{Ext}^n(k, A),$ where $\mathrm{Ext}$ is taken in the category
`Rep k G`.

To talk about cohomology in low degree, please see the file
`Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Homological/GroupCohomology/LowDegree.lean`, which provides API
specialized to `H⁰`, `H¹`, `H²`.

## Main definitions

* `groupCohomology.inhomogeneousCochains A`: a complex whose objects are
  $\mathrm{Fun}(G^n, A)$ and whose cohomology is the group cohomology $\mathrm{H}^n(G, A).$
* `groupCohomology.inhomogeneousCochainsIso A`: an isomorphism between the above complex and the
  complex $\mathrm{Hom}(P, A),$ where `P` is the bar resolution of `k` as a trivial resolution.
* `groupCohomology A n`: this is $\mathrm{H}^n(G, A),$ defined as the $n$th cohomology of
  `inhomogeneousCochains A`.
* `groupCohomologyIsoExt A n`: an isomorphism $\mathrm{H}^n(G, A) \cong \mathrm{Ext}^n(k, A)$
  (where $\mathrm{Ext}$ is taken in the category `Rep k G`) induced by `inhomogeneousCochainsIso A`.

## Implementation notes

Group cohomology is typically stated for `G`-modules, or equivalently modules over the group ring
`ℤ[G].` However, `ℤ` can be generalized to any commutative ring `k`, which is what we use.
Moreover, we express `k[G]`-module structures on a module `k`-module `A` using the `Rep`
definition. We avoid using instances `Module (MonoidAlgebra k G) A` so that we do not run into
possible scalar action diamonds.

## TODO

* The long exact sequence in cohomology attached to a short exact sequence of representations.
* Upgrading `groupCohomologyIsoExt` to an isomorphism of derived functors.
* Profinite cohomology.

Longer term:
* The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence (this is perhaps a good toy example for the theory of
  spectral sequences in general).
