# Cosets

This file develops the basic theory of left and right cosets.

When `G` is a group and `a : G`, `s : Set G`, with  `open scoped Pointwise` we can write:
* the left coset of `s` by `a` as `a • s`
* the right coset of `s` by `a` as `MulOpposite.op a • s` (or `op a • s` with `open MulOpposite`)

If instead `G` is an additive group, we can write (with  `open scoped Pointwise` still)
* the left coset of `s` by `a` as `a +ᵥ s`
* the right coset of `s` by `a` as `AddOpposite.op a +ᵥ s` (or `op a • s` with `open AddOpposite`)

## Main definitions

* `QuotientGroup.quotient s`: the quotient type representing the left cosets with respect to a
  subgroup `s`, for an `AddGroup` this is `QuotientAddGroup.quotient s`.
* `QuotientGroup.mk`: the canonical map from `α` to `α/s` for a subgroup `s` of `α`, for an
  `AddGroup` this is `QuotientAddGroup.mk`.

## Notation

* `G ⧸ H` is the quotient of the (additive) group `G` by the (additive) subgroup `H`

## TODO

Properly merge with pointwise actions on sets, by renaming and deduplicating lemmas as appropriate.
