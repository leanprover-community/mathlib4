# Divisible Group and rootable group

In this file, we define a divisible additive monoid and a rootable monoid with some basic
properties.

## Main definition

* `DivisibleBy A α`: An additive monoid `A` is said to be divisible by `α` iff for all `n ≠ 0 ∈ α`
  and `y ∈ A`, there is an `x ∈ A` such that `n • x = y`. In this file, we adopt a constructive
  approach, i.e. we ask for an explicit `div : A → α → A` function such that `div a 0 = 0` and
  `n • div a n = a` for all `n ≠ 0 ∈ α`.
* `RootableBy A α`: A monoid `A` is said to be rootable by `α` iff for all `n ≠ 0 ∈ α` and `y ∈ A`,
  there is an `x ∈ A` such that `x^n = y`. In this file, we adopt a constructive approach, i.e. we
  ask for an explicit `root : A → α → A` function such that `root a 0 = 1` and `(root a n)ⁿ = a` for
  all `n ≠ 0 ∈ α`.

## Main results

For additive monoids and groups:

* `divisibleByOfSMulRightSurj` : the constructive definition of divisibility is implied by
  the condition that `n • x = a` has solutions for all `n ≠ 0` and `a ∈ A`.
* `smul_right_surj_of_divisibleBy` : the constructive definition of divisibility implies
  the condition that `n • x = a` has solutions for all `n ≠ 0` and `a ∈ A`.
* `Prod.divisibleBy` : `A × B` is divisible for any two divisible additive monoids.
* `Pi.divisibleBy` : any product of divisible additive monoids is divisible.
* `AddGroup.divisibleByIntOfDivisibleByNat` : for additive groups, int divisibility is implied
  by nat divisibility.
* `AddGroup.divisibleByNatOfDivisibleByInt` : for additive groups, nat divisibility is implied
  by int divisibility.
* `AddCommGroup.divisibleByIntOfSMulTopEqTop`: the constructive definition of divisibility
  is implied by the condition that `n • A = A` for all `n ≠ 0`.
* `AddCommGroup.smul_top_eq_top_of_divisibleBy_int`: the constructive definition of divisibility
  implies the condition that `n • A = A` for all `n ≠ 0`.
* `divisibleByIntOfCharZero` : any field of characteristic zero is divisible.
* `QuotientAddGroup.divisibleBy` : quotient group of divisible group is divisible.
* `Function.Surjective.divisibleBy` : if `A` is divisible and `A →+ B` is surjective, then `B`
  is divisible.

and their multiplicative counterparts:

* `rootableByOfPowLeftSurj` : the constructive definition of rootability is implied by the
  condition that `xⁿ = y` has solutions for all `n ≠ 0` and `a ∈ A`.
* `pow_left_surj_of_rootableBy` : the constructive definition of rootability implies the
  condition that `xⁿ = y` has solutions for all `n ≠ 0` and `a ∈ A`.
* `Prod.rootableBy` : any product of two rootable monoids is rootable.
* `Pi.rootableBy` : any product of rootable monoids is rootable.
* `Group.rootableByIntOfRootableByNat` : in groups, int rootability is implied by nat
  rootability.
* `Group.rootableByNatOfRootableByInt` : in groups, nat rootability is implied by int
  rootability.
* `QuotientGroup.rootableBy` : quotient group of rootable group is rootable.
* `Function.Surjective.rootableBy` : if `A` is rootable and `A →* B` is surjective, then `B` is
  rootable.

TODO: Show that divisibility implies injectivity in the category of `AddCommGroup`.
