# Eckmann-Hilton argument

The Eckmann-Hilton argument says that if a type carries two monoid structures that distribute
over one another, then they are equal, and in addition commutative.
The main application lies in proving that higher homotopy groups (`πₙ` for `n ≥ 2`) are commutative.

## Main declarations

* `EckmannHilton.commMonoid`: If a type carries a unital magma structure that distributes
  over a unital binary operation, then the magma is a commutative monoid.
* `EckmannHilton.commGroup`: If a type carries a group structure that distributes
  over a unital binary operation, then the group is commutative.
