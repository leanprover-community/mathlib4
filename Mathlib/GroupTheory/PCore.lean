# The `p`-core of a group

For a group `G` and a natural number `p`, the **`p`-core** `O_p(G)` is the
largest normal `p`-subgroup of `G`. We define it as the supremum of all
normal `p`-subgroups, prove that it is normal, and prove that it is itself
a `p`-group (no finiteness hypothesis needed: the family of normal
`p`-subgroups is directed under `≤`).

## Main definitions

* `Subgroup.pCore p G` : the `p`-core of `G`, classically denoted `O_p(G)`.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.pCore_normal` (instance), `Subgroup.isPGroup_pCore`:
  `pCore p G` is a normal `p`-subgroup, with no finiteness hypothesis.
* `Subgroup.normal_le_pCore`: for `N` normal in `G`, `N ≤ pCore p G ↔ IsPGroup p N`
  — the universal property.
* `Subgroup.pCore_eq_iInf_sylow`: `pCore p G = ⨅ P : Sylow p G, (P : Subgroup G)`.
* `Subgroup.comap_pCore_eq_pCore`, `MulEquiv.map_pCore`, and surrounding
  lemmas describe the behaviour of `pCore` under group homomorphisms.

## TODO

* Interaction with `IsSolvable` and the upper Fitting series.

/-- The **`p`-core** `O_p(G)` of a group `G`: the supremum of all normal
`p`-subgroups. By `isPGroup_pCore` this is itself a `p`-group, and so is
the largest normal `p`-subgroup of `G`.

which makes `Subgroup.iSup_induction` directly applicable. -/
