# The `p`-core of a group

For a group `G` and a natural number `p`, the **`p`-core** `O_p(G)` is the
largest normal `p`-subgroup of `G`. We define it as the supremum of all
normal `p`-subgroups, prove that it is normal, and prove that it is itself
a `p`-group (no finiteness hypothesis needed: the family of normal
`p`-subgroups is directed under `≤`).

## Main definitions

* `Subgroup.pCore p G` : the `p`-core of `G`, classically denoted `O_p(G)`.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.pCore_normal` (instance) : `pCore p G` is normal in `G`.
* `Subgroup.isPGroup_pCore` : `pCore p G` is itself a `p`-group.
* `Subgroup.le_pCore` : every normal `p`-subgroup of `G` is contained in
  `pCore p G`.
* `Subgroup.normal_le_pCore` : for `N` normal in `G`, `N ≤ pCore p G`
  iff `N` is a `p`-group.
* `Subgroup.mem_pCore_iff` : an element lies in `pCore p G` iff it lies in
  some normal `p`-subgroup.
* `Subgroup.pCore_eq_bot_iff` : `pCore p G = ⊥` iff `G` has no non-trivial
  normal `p`-subgroup.
* `Subgroup.pCore_eq_top_iff` : `pCore p G = ⊤` iff `G` is itself a `p`-group.
* `Subgroup.pCore_eq_iInf_sylow` : for finite `G` and prime `p`, the
  `p`-core equals the intersection of all Sylow `p`-subgroups.
* `Subgroup.map_pCore_le_pCore` (surjective `f`) and
  `Subgroup.comap_pCore_le_pCore` (`p`-group kernel) describe how the
  `p`-core behaves under group homomorphisms;
  `Subgroup.comap_pCore_eq_pCore` gives the equality when both
  conditions hold, and `MulEquiv.map_pCore` is the isomorphism case.

## Terminology

The notation `O_p(G)` for the `p`-core is classical; in code we use the
descriptive name `pCore`.

## TODO

* Interaction with `IsSolvable` and the upper Fitting series.

/-- The **`p`-core** `O_p(G)` of a group `G`: the supremum of all normal
`p`-subgroups. By `isPGroup_pCore` this is itself a `p`-group, and so is
the largest normal `p`-subgroup of `G`.

We define it via an `iSup` over the subtype of normal `p`-subgroups,
which makes `Subgroup.iSup_induction` directly applicable. -/
