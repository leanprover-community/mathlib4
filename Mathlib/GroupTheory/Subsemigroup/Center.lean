# Centers of semigroups, as subsemigroups.

## Main definitions

* `Subsemigroup.center`: the center of a semigroup
* `AddSubsemigroup.center`: the center of an additive semigroup

We provide `Submonoid.center`, `AddSubmonoid.center`, `Subgroup.center`, `AddSubgroup.center`,
`Subsemiring.center`, and `Subring.center` in other files.
