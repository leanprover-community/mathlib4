# Equivariant homomorphisms

## Main definitions

* `MulActionEquiv φ X Y`, the type of equivariant isomorphisms from `X` to `Y`,
  where `φ : M ≃ N` is an equivalence, `M` acting on the type `X` and `N` acting on the type of `Y`.
  `AddActionEquiv φ X Y` is its additive version.

The above types have corresponding classes:
* `MulActionEquivClass F φ X Y` states that `F` is a type of bundled `X ≃ Y` isoms
  which are `φ`-equivariant;
  `AddActionEquivClass F φ X Y` is its additive version.

## Notation

We introduce the following notation to code equivariant isomorphisms
(the subscript index `ₑ` is for *equivariant*) :
* `X ≃ₑ[φ] Y` is `MulActionEquiv φ X Y` and `AddActionEquiv φ X Y`

When `M = N` and `φ = MulEquiv.refl M`, we provide the backward compatible notation :
* `X ≃[M] Y` is `MulActionHom (Equiv.refl M) X Y` and `AddActionHom (Equiv.refl M) X Y`

The notation for `MulActionHom` and `AddActionHom` is the same, because it is unlikely
that it could lead to confusion — unless one needs types `M` and `X` with simultaneous
instances of `Mul M`, `Add M`, `SMul M X` and `VAdd M X`…

## TODO
* `DistribMulActionEquiv φ A B` (`A ≃ₑ+[φ] B`)
  the type of equivariant additive monoid isomorphisms from `A` to `B`,
  where `φ : M ≃ N` is an isomorphism of monoids,
  `M` acting on the additive monoid `A` and `N` acting on the additive monoid of `B`
* `SMulSemiringEquiv φ R S`, the type of equivariant ring isomorphisms
  from `R` to `S`, where `φ : M → N` is an isomorphism of monoids,
  `M` acting on the ring `R` and `N` acting on the ring `S`.
* `DistribMulActionEquivClass F φ A B` states that `F` is a type of bundled `A ≃ B` isoms
  preserving the additive monoid structure and `φ`-equivariant
* `SMulSemiringEquivClass F φ R S` states that `F` is a type of bundled `R ≃ S` isoms
  preserving the ring structure and `φ`-equivariant

* `A ≃+[M] B` is `DistribMulActionHom (MulEquiv.refl M) A B`
* `R ≃+*[M] S` is `MulSemiringActionHom (MulEquiv.refl M) R S`
