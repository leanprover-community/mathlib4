# Fixing submonoid, fixing subgroup of an action

In the presence of an action of a monoid or a group,
this file defines the fixing submonoid or the fixing subgroup,
and relates it to the set of fixed points via a Galois connection.

## Main definitions

* `fixingSubmonoid M s` : in the presence of `MulAction M α` (with `Monoid M`)
  it is the `Submonoid M` consisting of elements which fix `s : Set α` pointwise.

* `fixingSubmonoid_fixedPoints_gc M α` is the `GaloisConnection`
  that relates `fixingSubmonoid` with `fixedPoints`.

* `fixingSubgroup M s` : in the presence of `MulAction M α` (with `Group M`)
  it is the `Subgroup M` consisting of elements which fix `s : Set α` pointwise.

* `fixingSubgroup_fixedPoints_gc M α` is the `GaloisConnection`
  that relates `fixingSubgroup` with `fixedPoints`.

TODO :

* Maybe other lemmas are useful

* Treat semigroups ?

* add `to_additive` for the various lemmas
