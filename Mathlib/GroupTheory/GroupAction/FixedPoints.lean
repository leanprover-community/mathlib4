# Properties of `fixedPoints` and `fixedBy`

This module contains some useful properties of `MulAction.fixedPoints` and `MulAction.fixedBy`
that don't directly belong to `Mathlib.GroupTheory.GroupAction.Basic`.

## Main theorems

* `MulAction.fixedBy_mul`: `fixedBy α (g * h) ⊆ fixedBy α g ∪ fixedBy α h`
* `MulAction.fixedBy_conj` and `MulAction.smul_fixedBy`: the pointwise group action of `h` on
  `fixedBy α g` is equal to the `fixedBy` set of the conjugation of `h` with `g`
  (`fixedBy α (h * g * h⁻¹)`).
* `MulAction.set_mem_fixedBy_of_movedBy_subset` shows that if a set `s` is a superset of
  `(fixedBy α g)ᶜ`, then the group action of `g` cannot send elements of `s` outside of `s`.
  This is expressed as `s ∈ fixedBy (Set α) g`, and `MulAction.set_mem_fixedBy_iff` allows one
  to convert the relationship back to `g • x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ s`.
* `MulAction.not_commute_of_disjoint_smul_movedBy` allows one to prove that `g` and `h`
  do not commute from the disjointness of the `(fixedBy α g)ᶜ` set and `h • (fixedBy α g)ᶜ`,
  which is a property used in the proof of Rubin's theorem.

The theorems above are also available for `AddAction`.

## Pointwise group action and `fixedBy (Set α) g`

Since `fixedBy α g = { x | g • x = x }` by definition, properties about the pointwise action of
a set `s : Set α` can be expressed using `fixedBy (Set α) g`.
To properly use theorems using `fixedBy (Set α) g`, you should `open Pointwise` in your file.

`s ∈ fixedBy (Set α) g` means that `g • s = s`, which is equivalent to say that
`∀ x, g • x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ s` (the translation can be done using `MulAction.set_mem_fixedBy_iff`).

`s ∈ fixedBy (Set α) g` is a weaker statement than `s ⊆ fixedBy α g`: the latter requires that
all points in `s` are fixed by `g`, whereas the former only requires that `g • x ∈ s`.
