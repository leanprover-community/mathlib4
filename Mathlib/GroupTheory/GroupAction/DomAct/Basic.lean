# Type tags for right action on the domain of a function

By default, `M` acts on `α → β` if it acts on `β`, and the action is given by
`(c • f) a = c • (f a)`.

In some cases, it is useful to consider another action: if `M` acts on `α` on the left, then it acts
on `α → β` on the right so that `(c • f) a = f (c • a)`. E.g., this action is used to reformulate
the Mean Ergodic Theorem in terms of an operator on \(L^2\).

## Main definitions

- `DomMulAct M` (notation: `Mᵈᵐᵃ`): type synonym for `Mᵐᵒᵖ`; if `M` multiplicatively acts on `α`,
  then `Mᵈᵐᵃ` acts on `α → β` for any type `β`;
- `DomAddAct M` (notation: `Mᵈᵃᵃ`): the additive version.

We also define actions of `Mᵈᵐᵃ` on:

- `α → β` provided that `M` acts on `α`;
- `A →* B` provided that `M` acts on `A` by a `MulDistribMulAction`;
- `A →+ B` provided that `M` acts on `A` by a `DistribMulAction`.

## Implementation details

### Motivation

Right action can be represented in `mathlib` as an action of the opposite group `Mᵐᵒᵖ`. However,
this "domain shift" action cannot be an instance because this would create a "diamond"
(a.k.a. ambiguous notation): if `M` is a monoid, then how does `Mᵐᵒᵖ` act on `M → M`? On the one
hand, `Mᵐᵒᵖ` acts on `M` by `c • a = a * c.unop`, thus we have an action
`(c • f) a = f a * c.unop`. On the other hand, `M` acts on itself by multiplication on the left, so
with this new instance we would have `(c • f) a = f (c.unop * a)`. Clearly, these are two different
actions, so both of them cannot be instances in the library.

To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a type synonym `DomMulAct M := Mᵐᵒᵖ` (notation:
`Mᵈᵐᵃ`). This new type carries the same algebraic structures as `Mᵐᵒᵖ` but acts on `α → β` by this
new action. So, e.g., `Mᵈᵐᵃ` acts on `(M → M) → M` by `DomMulAct.mk c • F f = F (fun a ↦ c • f a)`
while `(Mᵈᵐᵃ)ᵈᵐᵃ` (which is isomorphic to `M`) acts on `(M → M) → M` by
`DomMulAct.mk (DomMulAct.mk c) • F f = F (fun a ↦ f (c • a))`.

### Action on bundled homomorphisms

If the action of `M` on `A` preserves some structure, then `Mᵈᵐᵃ` acts on bundled homomorphisms from
`A` to any type `B` that preserve the same structure. Examples (some of them are not yet in the
library) include:

- a `MulDistribMulAction` generates an action on `A →* B`;
- a `DistribMulAction` generates an action on `A →+ B`;
- an action on `α` that commutes with action of some other monoid `N` generates an action on
  `α →[N] β`;
- a `DistribMulAction` on an `R`-module that commutes with scalar multiplications by `c : R`
  generates an action on `R`-linear maps from this module;
- a continuous action on `X` generates an action on `C(X, Y)`;
- a measurable action on `X` generates an action on `{ f : X → Y // Measurable f }`;
- a quasi measure preserving action on `X` generates an action on `X →ₘ[μ] Y`;
- a measure preserving action generates an isometric action on `MeasureTheory.Lp _ _ _`.

### Left action vs right action

It is common in the literature to consider the left action given by `(c • f) a = f (c⁻¹ • a)`
instead of the action defined in this file. However, this left action is defined only if `c` belongs
to a group, not to a monoid, so we decided to go with the right action.

The left action can be written in terms of `DomMulAct` as `(DomMulAct.mk c)⁻¹ • f`. As for higher
level dynamics objects (orbits, invariant functions etc), they coincide for the left and for the
right action, so lemmas can be formulated in terms of `DomMulAct`.
