/-! # Complements to pretransitive actions

When `f : X →ₑ[φ] Y` is an equivariant map with respect to a map
of monoids `φ: M → N`,

- `MulAction.IsPretransitive.of_surjective_map` shows that
  the action of `N` on `Y` is pretransitive
  if that of `M` on `X`  is pretransitive.

- `MulAction.isPretransitive_congr` shows that when
  `φ` is surjective, the action of `N` on `Y` is pretransitive
  iff that of `M` on `X`  is pretransitive.

Given `MulAction G X` where `G` is a group,
- `MulAction.isPretransitive_iff_base G a` shows that `IsPretransitive G X`
  iff every element is translated from `a`

- `MulAction.IsPretransitive.iff_orbit_eq_top G a` shows that `MulAction.IsPretransitive G X`
  iff `MulAction.orbit G a` is full.
