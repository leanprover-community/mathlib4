# Commensurability for subgroups

Two subgroups `H` and `K` of a group `G` are commensurable if `H ∩ K` has finite index in both `H`
and `K`.

This file defines commensurability for subgroups of a group `G`. It goes on to prove that
commensurability defines an equivalence relation on subgroups of `G` and finally defines the
commensurator of a subgroup `H` of `G`, which is the elements `g` of `G` such that `gHg⁻¹` is
commensurable with `H`.

## Main definitions

* `Commensurable H K`: the statement that the subgroups `H` and `K` of `G` are commensurable.
* `commensurator H`: the commensurator of a subgroup `H` of `G`.

## Implementation details

We define the commensurator of a subgroup `H` of `G` by first defining it as a subgroup of
`(conjAct G)`, which we call `commensurator'` and then taking the pre-image under
the map `G → (conjAct G)` to obtain our commensurator as a subgroup of `G`.
