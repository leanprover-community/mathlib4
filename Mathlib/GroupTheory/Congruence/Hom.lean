# Congruence relations and homomorphisms

This file contains elementary definitions involving congruence relations and morphisms.

## Main definitions

 * `Con.ker`: the kernel of a monoid homomorphism as a congruence relation
 * `Con.mk'`: the map from a monoid to its quotient by a congruence relation
 * `Con.lift`: the homomorphism on the quotient given that the congruence is in the kernel
 * `Con.map`: homomorphism from a smaller to a larger quotient
