# Congruence relations

This file proves basic properties of the quotient of a type by a congruence relation.

The second half of the file concerns congruence relations on monoids, in which case the
quotient by the congruence relation is also a monoid. There are results about the universal
property of quotients of monoids, and the isomorphism theorems for monoids.

## Implementation notes

A congruence relation on a monoid `M` can be thought of as a submonoid of `M × M` for which
membership is an equivalence relation, but whilst this fact is established in the file, it is not
used, since this perspective adds more layers of definitional unfolding.
