# Archimedean groups

This file proves a few facts about ordered groups which satisfy the `Archimedean` property, that is:
`class Archimedean (α) [OrderedAddCommMonoid α] : Prop :=`
`(arch : ∀ (x : α) {y}, 0 < y → ∃ n : ℕ, x ≤ n • y)`

They are placed here in a separate file (rather than incorporated as a continuation of
`Algebra.Order.Archimedean`) because they rely on some imports from `GroupTheory` -- bundled
subgroups in particular.

The main result is `AddSubgroup.cyclic_of_min`:  a subgroup of a decidable archimedean abelian
group is cyclic, if its set of positive elements has a minimal element.

This result is used in this file to deduce `Int.subgroup_cyclic`, proving that every subgroup of `ℤ`
is cyclic.  (There are several other methods one could use to prove this fact, including more purely
algebraic methods, but none seem to exist in mathlib as of writing.  The closest is
`Subgroup.is_cyclic`, but that has not been transferred to `AddSubgroup`.)

The result is also used in `Topology.Instances.Real` as an ingredient in the classification of
subgroups of `ℝ`.
