# Grothendieck group

The Grothendieck group of a commutative monoid `M` is the "smallest" commutative group `G`
containing `M`, in the sense that monoid homs `M → H` are in bijection with monoid homs `G → H` for
any commutative group `H`.

Note that "Grothendieck group" also refers to the analogous construction in an abelian category
obtained by formally making the last term of each short exact sequence invertible.
