# Defining a group given by generators and relations

Given a subset `rels` of relations of the free group on a type `α`, this file constructs the group
given by generators `x : α` and relations `r ∈ rels`.

## Main definitions

* `PresentedGroup rels`: the quotient group of the free group on a type `α` by a subset `rels` of
  relations of the free group on `α`.
* `of`: The canonical map from `α` to a presented group with generators `α`.
* `toGroup f`: the canonical group homomorphism `PresentedGroup rels → G`, given a function
  `f : α → G` from a type `α` to a group `G` which satisfies the relations `rels`.

Presented groups satisfy a universal property. If `G` is a group and `f : α → G` is a map such that
the images of `f` satisfy all the given relations, then `f` extends uniquely to a group homomorphism
from `PresentedGroup rels` to `G`.
