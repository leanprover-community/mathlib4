# Solvable Groups

In this file we introduce the notion of a solvable group. We define a solvable group as one whose
derived series is eventually trivial. This requires defining the commutator of two subgroups and
the derived series of a group.

## Main definitions

* `derivedSeries G n` : the `n`th term in the derived series of `G`, defined by iterating
    `general_commutator` starting with the top subgroup
* `IsSolvable G` : the group `G` is solvable
