# The First Main Theorem of Value Distribution Theory

The First Main Theorem of Value Distribution Theory is a two-part statement, establishing invariance
of the characteristic function `characteristic f ⊤` under modifications of `f`.

- If `f` is meromorphic on the complex plane, then the characteristic functions for the value `⊤` of
  the function `f` and `f⁻¹` agree up to a constant, see Proposition 2.1 on p. 168 of [Lang,
  *Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces*][MR886677].

- If `f` is meromorphic on the complex plane, then the characteristic functions for the value `⊤` of
  the function `f` and `f - const` agree up to a constant, see Proposition 2.2 on p. 168 of [Lang,
  *Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces*][MR886677]

See Section VI.2 of [Lang, *Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces*][MR886677] or Section 1.1 of
[Noguchi-Winkelmann, *Nevanlinna Theory in Several Complex Variables and Diophantine
Approximation*][MR3156076] for a detailed discussion.
