# The Characteristic Function of Value Distribution Theory

This file defines the "characteristic function" attached to a meromorphic function defined on the
complex plane.  Also known as "Nevanlinna Height", this is one of the three main functions used in
Value Distribution Theory.

The characteristic function plays a role analogous to the height function in number theory: both
measure the "complexity" of objects. For rational functions, the characteristic function grows like
the degree times the logarithm, much like the logarithmic height in number theory reflects the
degree of an algebraic number.

See Section~VI.2 of [Lang, *Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces*][MR886677] or Section~1.1 of
[Noguchi-Winkelmann, *Nevanlinna Theory in Several Complex Variables and Diophantine
Approximation*][MR3156076] for a detailed discussion.

### TODO

- Characterize rational functions in terms of the growth rate of their characteristic function, as
  discussed in Theorem 2.6 on p. 170 of [Lang, *Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic
  Spaces*][MR886677].

The Characteristic Function of Value Distribution Theory

If `f : ℂ → E` is meromorphic and `a : WithTop E` is any value, the characteristic function of `f`
is defined as the sum of two terms: the proximity function, which quantifies how close `f` gets to
`a` on the circle `∣z∣ = r`, and the counting function, which counts the number times that `f`
attains the value `a` inside the disk `∣z∣ ≤ r`, weighted by multiplicity.

The difference between the characteristic functions of `f` and `f - const` simplifies to the
difference between the proximity functions.
