# Schwarz lemma

In this file we prove several versions of the Schwarz lemma.

* `Complex.norm_deriv_le_div_of_mapsTo_ball`. Let `f : ℂ → E` be a complex analytic function
  on an open disk with center `c` and a positive radius `R₁`.
  If `f` sends this ball to a closed ball with center `f c` and radius `R₂`,
  then the norm of the derivative of `f` at `c` is at most the ratio `R₂ / R₁`.

* `Complex.dist_le_div_mul_dist_of_mapsTo_ball`. Let `f : E → F` be a complex analytic function
  on an open ball with center `c` and radius `R₁`.
  If `f` sends this ball to a closed ball with center `f c` and radius `R₂`,
  then for any `z` in the former ball we have `dist (f z) (f c) ≤ (R₂ / R₁) * dist z c`.

* `Complex.norm_deriv_le_one_of_mapsTo_ball`. If `f : ℂ → E` is complex analytic
  on an open disk with center `c` and a positive radius `R₁`,
  and it sends this disk to a closed ball with center `f c` and radius the same radius,
  then the norm of the derivative of `f` at the center of this disk is at most `1`.

* `Complex.dist_le_dist_of_mapsTo_ball`. Let `f : E → F` be a complex analytic function
  on an open ball with center `c`.
  If `f` sends this ball to a closed ball with center `f c` and the same radius,
  then for any `z` in the former ball we have `dist (f z) (f c) ≤ dist z c`.

* `Complex.norm_le_norm_of_mapsTo_ball`:
  Let `f : E → F` be a complex analytic on an open ball with center at the origin.
  If `f` sends this ball to the closed ball with center `0` of the same radius and `f 0 = 0`,
  then for any point `z` of this disk we have `‖f z‖ ≤ ‖z‖`.

## Implementation notes

Traditionally, the Schwarz lemma is formulated for maps `f : ℂ → ℂ`.
We generalize all versions of the lemma to the case of maps to any normed space.
For the versions that don't use `deriv` or `dslope`,
we state it for maps between any two normed spaces.

## TODO

* Prove that any diffeomorphism of the unit disk to itself is a Möbius map.
