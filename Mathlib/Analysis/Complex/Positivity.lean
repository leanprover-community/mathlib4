# Nonnegativity of values of holomorphic functions

We show that if `f` is holomorphic on an open disk `B(c,r)` and all iterated derivatives of `f`
at `c` are nonnegative real, then `f z ≥ 0` for all `z ≥ c` in the disk; see
`DifferentiableOn.nonneg_of_iteratedDeriv_nonneg`. We also provide a
variant `Differentiable.nonneg_of_iteratedDeriv_nonneg` for entire functions and versions
showing `f z ≥ f c` when all iterated derivatives except `f` itseld are nonnegative.
