# Continuity of series of functions

We show that series of functions are continuous when each individual function in the series is and
additionally suitable uniform summable bounds are satisfied, in `continuous_tsum`.

For smoothness of series of functions, see the file `Analysis.Calculus.SmoothSeries`.
