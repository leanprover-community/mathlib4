# The integers as normed ring

This file contains basic facts about the integers as normed ring.

Recall that `‖n‖` denotes the norm of `n` as real number.
This norm is always nonnegative, so we can bundle the norm together with this fact,
to obtain a term of type `NNReal` (the nonnegative real numbers).
The resulting nonnegative real number is denoted by `‖n‖₊`.
