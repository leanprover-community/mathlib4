# Homeomorphism between a normed space and sphere times `(0, +∞)`

In this file we define a homeomorphism between nonzero elements of a normed space `E`
and `Metric.sphere (0 : E) 1 × Set.Ioi (0 : ℝ)`.
One may think about it as generalization of polar coordinates to any normed space.

/-- The natural homeomorphism between nonzero elements of a normed space `E`
and `Metric.sphere (0 : E) 1 × Set.Ioi (0 : ℝ)`.

The forward map sends `⟨x, hx⟩` to `⟨‖x‖⁻¹ • x, ‖x‖⟩`,
the inverse map sends `(x, r)` to `r • x`.

One may think about it as generalization of polar coordinates to any normed space. -/
