# WithAbs

`WithAbs v` is a type synonym for a semiring `R` which depends on an absolute value. The point of
this is to allow the type class inference system to handle multiple sources of instances that
arise from absolute values. See `NumberTheory.NumberField.Completion` for an example of this
being used to define Archimedean completions of a number field.

## Main definitions
 - `WithAbs` : type synonym for a semiring which depends on an absolute value. This is
  a function that takes an absolute value on a semiring and returns the semiring. This can be used
  to assign and infer instances on a semiring that depend on absolute values.
 - `WithAbs.equiv v` : the canonical (type) equivalence between `WithAbs v` and `R`.
 - `WithAbs.ringEquiv v` : The canonical ring equivalence between `WithAbs v` and `R`.
 - `AbsoluteValue.Completion` : the uniform space completion of a field `K` according to the
  uniform structure defined by the specified real absolute value.
