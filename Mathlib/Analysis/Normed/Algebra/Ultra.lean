# Normed algebra preserves ultrametricity

This file contains the proof that a normed division ring over an ultrametric field is ultrametric.

The other direction of `IsUltrametricDist.of_normedAlgebra`.
Let `K` be a normed field. If a seminormed ring `L` is a normed `K`-algebra, and `‖1‖ = 1` in `L`,
then `K` is ultrametric (i.e. the norm on `L` is nonarchimedean) if `F` is.
This can be further generalized to the case where `‖1‖ ≠ 0` in `L`.
