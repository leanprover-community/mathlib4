# Quotients of seminormed groups

For any `SeminormedAddCommGroup M` and any `S : AddSubgroup M`, we provide a
`SeminormedAddCommGroup`, the group quotient `M ⧸ S`.
If `S` is closed, we provide `NormedAddCommGroup (M ⧸ S)` (regardless of whether `M` itself is
separated). The two main properties of these structures are the underlying topology is the quotient
topology and the projection is a normed group homomorphism which is norm non-increasing
(better, it has operator norm exactly one unless `S` is dense in `M`). The corresponding
universal property is that every normed group hom defined on `M` which vanishes on `S` descends
to a normed group hom defined on `M ⧸ S`.

This file also introduces a predicate `IsQuotient` characterizing normed group homs that
are isomorphic to the canonical projection onto a normed group quotient.

In addition, this file also provides normed structures for quotients of modules by submodules, and
of (commutative) rings by ideals. The `SeminormedAddCommGroup` and `NormedAddCommGroup`
instances described above are transferred directly, but we also define instances of `NormedSpace`,
`SeminormedCommRing`, `NormedCommRing` and `NormedAlgebra` under appropriate type class
assumptions on the original space. Moreover, while `QuotientAddGroup.completeSpace` works
out-of-the-box for quotients of `NormedAddCommGroup`s by `AddSubgroup`s, we need to transfer
this instance in `Submodule.Quotient.completeSpace` so that it applies to these other quotients.

## Main definitions


We use `M` and `N` to denote seminormed groups and `S : AddSubgroup M`.
All the following definitions are in the `AddSubgroup` namespace. Hence we can access
`AddSubgroup.normedMk S` as `S.normedMk`.

* `seminormedAddCommGroupQuotient` : The seminormed group structure on the quotient by
    an additive subgroup. This is an instance so there is no need to explicitly use it.

* `normedAddCommGroupQuotient` : The normed group structure on the quotient by
    a closed additive subgroup. This is an instance so there is no need to explicitly use it.

* `normedMk S` : the normed group hom from `M` to `M ⧸ S`.

* `lift S f hf`: implements the universal property of `M ⧸ S`. Here
    `(f : NormedAddGroupHom M N)`, `(hf : ∀ s ∈ S, f s = 0)` and
    `lift S f hf : NormedAddGroupHom (M ⧸ S) N`.

* `IsQuotient`: given `f : NormedAddGroupHom M N`, `IsQuotient f` means `N` is isomorphic
    to a quotient of `M` by a subgroup, with projection `f`. Technically it asserts `f` is
    surjective and the norm of `f x` is the infimum of the norms of `x + m` for `m` in `f.ker`.

## Main results

* `norm_normedMk` : the operator norm of the projection is `1` if the subspace is not dense.

* `IsQuotient.norm_lift`: Provided `f : normed_hom M N` satisfies `IsQuotient f`, for every
     `n : N` and positive `ε`, there exists `m` such that `f m = n ∧ ‖m‖ < ‖n‖ + ε`.


## Implementation details

For any `SeminormedAddCommGroup M` and any `S : AddSubgroup M` we define a norm on `M ⧸ S` by
`‖x‖ = sInf (norm '' {m | mk' S m = x})`. This formula is really an implementation detail, it
shouldn't be needed outside of this file setting up the theory.

Since `M ⧸ S` is automatically a topological space (as any quotient of a topological space),
one needs to be careful while defining the `SeminormedAddCommGroup` instance to avoid having two
different topologies on this quotient. This is not purely a technological issue.
Mathematically there is something to prove. The main point is proved in the auxiliary lemma
`quotient_nhd_basis` that has no use beyond this verification and states that zero in the quotient
admits as basis of neighborhoods in the quotient topology the sets `{x | ‖x‖ < ε}` for positive `ε`.

Once this mathematical point is settled, we have two topologies that are propositionally equal. This
is not good enough for the type class system. As usual we ensure *definitional* equality
using forgetful inheritance, see Note [forgetful inheritance]. A (semi)-normed group structure
includes a uniform space structure which includes a topological space structure, together
with propositional fields asserting compatibility conditions.
The usual way to define a `SeminormedAddCommGroup` is to let Lean build a uniform space structure
using the provided norm, and then trivially build a proof that the norm and uniform structure are
compatible. Here the uniform structure is provided using `IsTopologicalAddGroup.toUniformSpace`
which uses the topological structure and the group structure to build the uniform structure. This
uniform structure induces the correct topological structure by construction, but the fact that it
is compatible with the norm is not obvious; this is where the mathematical content explained in
the previous paragraph kicks in.

### Submodules and ideals

In what follows, the norm structures created above for quotients of (semi)`NormedAddCommGroup`s
by `AddSubgroup`s are transferred via definitional equality to quotients of modules by submodules,
and of rings by ideals, thereby preserving the definitional equality for the topological group and
uniform structures worked for above. Completeness is also transferred via this definitional
equality.

In addition, instances are constructed for `NormedSpace`, `SeminormedCommRing`,
`NormedCommRing` and `NormedAlgebra` under the appropriate hypotheses. Currently, we do not
have quotients of rings by two-sided ideals, hence the commutativity hypotheses are required.
