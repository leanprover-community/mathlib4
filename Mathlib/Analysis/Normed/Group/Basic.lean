# Normed (semi)groups

In this file we define 10 classes:

* `Norm`, `NNNorm`: auxiliary classes endowing a type `α` with a function `norm : α → ℝ`
  (notation: `‖x‖`) and `nnnorm : α → ℝ≥0` (notation: `‖x‖₊`), respectively;
* `Seminormed...Group`: A seminormed (additive) (commutative) group is an (additive) (commutative)
  group with a norm and a compatible pseudometric space structure:
  `∀ x y, dist x y = ‖x / y‖` or `∀ x y, dist x y = ‖x - y‖`, depending on the group operation.
* `Normed...Group`: A normed (additive) (commutative) group is an (additive) (commutative) group
  with a norm and a compatible metric space structure.

We also prove basic properties of (semi)normed groups and provide some instances.

## TODO
This file is huge; move material into separate files,
such as `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Group/Lemmas.lean`.

## Notes

The current convention `dist x y = ‖x - y‖` means that the distance is invariant under right
addition, but actions in mathlib are usually from the left. This means we might want to change it to
`dist x y = ‖-x + y‖`.

The normed group hierarchy would lend itself well to a mixin design (that is, having
`SeminormedGroup` and `SeminormedAddGroup` not extend `Group` and `AddGroup`), but we choose not
to for performance concerns.
