# Weak dual of normed space

Let `E` be a normed space over a field `𝕜`. This file is concerned with properties of the weak-*
topology on the dual of `E`. By the dual, we mean either of the type synonyms
`StrongDual 𝕜 E` or `WeakDual 𝕜 E`, depending on whether it is viewed as equipped with its usual
operator norm topology or the weak-* topology.

It is shown that the canonical mapping `StrongDual 𝕜 E → WeakDual 𝕜 E` is continuous, and
as a consequence the weak-* topology is coarser than the topology obtained from the operator norm
(dual norm).

The file also equips `WeakDual 𝕜 E` with the norm bornology inherited from `StrongDual 𝕜 E`, so
that `IsBounded` refers to operator-norm boundedness. This is a pragmatic choice discussed
further in the implementation notes.

We establish the Banach-Alaoglu theorem about the compactness of closed balls in the dual of `E`
(as well as sets of somewhat more general form) with respect to the weak-* topology.

The first main result concerns the comparison of the operator norm topology on `StrongDual 𝕜 E` and
the weak-* topology on (its type synonym) `WeakDual 𝕜 E`:
* `dual_norm_topology_le_weak_dual_topology`: The weak-* topology on the dual of a normed space is
  coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the operator norm topology.
* `WeakDual.isCompact_polar` (a version of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem): The polar set of a
  neighborhood of the origin in a normed space `E` over `𝕜` is compact in `WeakDual _ E`, if the
  nontrivially normed field `𝕜` is proper as a topological space.
* `WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall` (the most common special case of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem):
  Closed balls in the dual of a normed space `E` over `ℝ` or `ℂ` are compact in the weak-star
  topology.

## Main definitions

* `StrongDual.toWeakDual` and `WeakDual.toStrongDual`: Linear equivalences between the dual types.
* `WeakDual.instBornology`: The norm bornology on `WeakDual 𝕜 E`.
* `WeakDual.seminormFamily`: The family of seminorms `fun x f ↦ ‖f x‖` generating the weak-*
  topology.
* `WeakDual.polar`: The polar set of `s : Set E` viewed as a subset of `WeakDual 𝕜 E`.

## Main results

### Topology comparison
* `NormedSpace.Dual.toWeakDual_continuous`: The weak-* topology is coarser than the norm topology.

### Bornology and pointwise bounds
* `WeakDual.isBounded_iff_isVonNBounded`: Equivalence of norm and weak-* boundedness for
  Banach spaces.

### Compactness and Banach-Alaoglu
* `WeakDual.isCompact_polar`: Polars of neighborhoods of the origin are weak-* compact.
* `WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall`: Closed balls are weak-* compact.
* `WeakDual.isSeqCompact_closedBall`: Sequential version for separable spaces.

## Implementation notes

* **Topology synonym:** When `M` is a vector space, the duals `StrongDual 𝕜 M` and `WeakDual 𝕜 M`
  are type synonyms with different topology instances.
* **Bornology choice:** The `Bornology` instance on `WeakDual 𝕜 E` is inherited from
  `StrongDual 𝕜 E` via `inferInstanceAs` and corresponds to the operator-norm bornology.
  While the natural bornology for a weak topology is technically the von Neumann bornology
  (pointwise boundedness), we use the norm bornology for several pragmatic reasons:
  1. **Practicality:** In the normed setting, "bounded" is almost universally synonymous with
     "norm-bounded". This allows `IsBounded` to be used directly in statements like Banach-Alaoglu.
  2. **Clarity:** It preserves a clear distinction between norm-boundedness (`IsBounded`) and
     topological weak-* boundedness (`IsVonNBounded`).
  3. **Consistency:** By the Uniform Boundedness Principle, these notions coincide whenever
     `E` is a Banach space (`isBounded_iff_isVonNBounded`).
* **Polar sets:** The polar set `polar 𝕜 s` of a subset `s` of `E` is originally defined as a
  subset of the dual `StrongDual 𝕜 E`. We care about properties of these w.r.t. weak-* topology,
  and for this purpose give the definition `WeakDual.polar 𝕜 s` for the "same" subset viewed as a
  subset of `WeakDual 𝕜 E` (a type synonym of the dual but with a different topology instance).
* **Banach-Alaoglu Proof:** The weak dual of `E` is embedded in the space of functions `E → 𝕜`
  with the topology of pointwise convergence.

## TODO
* Add that in finite dimensions, the weak-* topology and the dual norm topology coincide.
* Add that in infinite dimensions, the weak-* topology is strictly coarser than the dual norm
  topology.
* Add metrizability of the dual unit ball (more generally weak-star compact subsets) of
  `WeakDual 𝕜 E` under the assumption of separability of `E`.
* Add the sequential Banach-Alaoglu theorem: the dual unit ball of a separable normed space `E`
  is sequentially compact in the weak-star topology. This would follow from the metrizability above.

section Bornology

/-- The bornology on `WeakDual 𝕜 F` is the norm bornology inherited from `StrongDual 𝕜 F`.

Note: This is a pragmatic choice. To be precise, the bornology of a weak topology should be
the von Neumann bornology (pointwise boundedness). However, in the normed setting,
`IsBounded` is most useful when referring to the operator norm (e.g., to state
Banach-Alaoglu concisely).

Pointwise boundedness is instead captured by `Bornology.IsVonNBounded`.
For Banach spaces, these notions coincide via `isBounded_iff_isVonNBounded`.
See the module docstring for more details. -/

### Weak star topology on duals of normed spaces

In this section, we prove properties about the weak-* topology on duals of normed spaces.
We prove in particular that the canonical mapping `StrongDual 𝕜 E → WeakDual 𝕜 E` is continuous,
i.e., that the weak-* topology is coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the topology given
by the dual-norm (i.e. the operator-norm).

### Bornology and pointwise bounds

This section relates the inherited norm bornology (`IsBounded`) to the intrinsic
von Neumann bornology of the weak-* topology (`IsVonNBounded`).

The following results justify using the norm bornology as the default instance: by the
Uniform Boundedness Principle, it coincides with the von Neumann bornology whenever
$E$ is a Banach space.
