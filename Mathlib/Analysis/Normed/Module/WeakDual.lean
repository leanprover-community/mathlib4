# Weak dual of normed space

Let `E` be a normed space over a field `𝕜`. This file is concerned with properties of the weak-*
topology on the dual of `E`. By the dual, we mean either of the type synonyms
`StrongDual 𝕜 E` or `WeakDual 𝕜 E`, depending on whether it is viewed as equipped with its usual
operator norm topology or the weak-* topology.

It is shown that the canonical mapping `StrongDual 𝕜 E → WeakDual 𝕜 E` is continuous, and
as a consequence the weak-* topology is coarser than the topology obtained from the operator norm
(dual norm).

In this file, we also establish the Banach-Alaoglu theorem about the compactness of closed balls
in the dual of `E` (as well as sets of somewhat more general form) with respect to the weak-*
topology.

## Main definitions

The main definitions concern the canonical mapping `StrongDual 𝕜 E → WeakDual 𝕜 E`.

* `StrongDual.toWeakDual` and `WeakDual.toStrongDual`: Linear equivalences from `StrongDual 𝕜 E` to
`WeakDual 𝕜 E` and in the converse direction.
* `NormedSpace.Dual.continuousLinearMapToWeakDual`: A continuous linear mapping from
  `StrongDual 𝕜 E` to `WeakDual 𝕜 E` (same as `StrongDual.toWeakDual` but different bundled data).

## Main results

The first main result concerns the comparison of the operator norm topology on `StrongDual 𝕜 E` and
the weak-* topology on (its type synonym) `WeakDual 𝕜 E`:
* `dual_norm_topology_le_weak_dual_topology`: The weak-* topology on the dual of a normed space is
  coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the operator norm topology.
* `WeakDual.isCompact_polar` (a version of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem): The polar set of a
  neighborhood of the origin in a normed space `E` over `𝕜` is compact in `WeakDual _ E`, if the
  nontrivially normed field `𝕜` is proper as a topological space.
* `WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall` (the most common special case of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem):
  Closed balls in the dual of a normed space `E` over `ℝ` or `ℂ` are compact in the weak-star
  topology.

## TODO
* Add that in finite dimensions, the weak-* topology and the dual norm topology coincide.
* Add that in infinite dimensions, the weak-* topology is strictly coarser than the dual norm
  topology.
* Add metrizability of the dual unit ball (more generally weak-star compact subsets) of
  `WeakDual 𝕜 E` under the assumption of separability of `E`.
* Add the sequential Banach-Alaoglu theorem: the dual unit ball of a separable normed space `E`
  is sequentially compact in the weak-star topology. This would follow from the metrizability above.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

Weak-* topology is defined generally in the file `Topology.Algebra.Module.WeakDual`.

When `M` is a vector space, the duals `StrongDual 𝕜 M` and `WeakDual 𝕜 M` are type synonyms with
different topology instances.

For the proof of Banach-Alaoglu theorem, the weak dual of `E` is embedded in the space of
functions `E → 𝕜` with the topology of pointwise convergence.

The polar set `polar 𝕜 s` of a subset `s` of `E` is originally defined as a subset of the dual
`StrongDual 𝕜 E`. We care about properties of these w.r.t. weak-* topology, and for this purpose
give the definition `WeakDual.polar 𝕜 s` for the "same" subset viewed as a subset of `WeakDual 𝕜 E`
(a type synonym of the dual but with a different topology instance).

### Weak star topology on duals of normed spaces

In this section, we prove properties about the weak-* topology on duals of normed spaces.
We prove in particular that the canonical mapping `StrongDual 𝕜 E → WeakDual 𝕜 E` is continuous,
i.e., that the weak-* topology is coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the topology given
by the dual-norm (i.e. the operator-norm).

- Definitions and basic properties of absolutely convex hulls

- Definitions and basic properties of closed convex and closed absolutely convex hulls
  https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/17983 -  TVS II.13
- The absolutely convex hull of a totally bounded (precompact) set is totally bounded (precompact)
  https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/17204 - Proposition 3 TVS II.25

N.B. absolutely convex = convex and balanced.

III.3 Prop 2 - In a locally convex space , every precompact (TotallyBounded) set is bounded
I think we have this as `TotallyBounded.isVonNBounded`

III.8 Def 6 An LCS is stb quasi-complete if every closed and bounded subset is complete.
A complete LCS is quasi-complete. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-complete_space

The totally bounded sets form a Bornology `totallyBoundedBornology`

In a Hausdorff quasi-complete space, the closure and the closed convex balanced envelope of a
precompact (TotallyBounded) subset are compact, in fact they are precompact (II, p25, prop3) and
complete being closed and (von Neumann) bounded. We have given this for complete spaces as
`isCompact_closedAbsConvexHull_of_totallyBounded`.

(Let S be precompact. closure S is precompact (`TotallyBounded.closure`) and VN Bounded
(`TotallyBounded.isVonNBounded`) and closed. Hence complete by the defining property of quasi-
complete. By `isCompact_iff_totallyBounded_isComplete` it is compact.)

From TVS IV.3 Example - when E is complete the T of compact convergence coincides with compact
convex convergence (III p8). The topology of compact convex convergence is compatible with the
duality. This is used in corollary 2 of the BD theorem

The topology of compact convex convergence is defined in TVS III.14 and is denoted `ℒ_cc(E;F)`

I think the key point is III.15 Prop 2 1) ?

III p8 In a Hausdorff quasi-complete space the closed convex balanced envelope of a totally bounded
subset is compact. In particular this is true for compact subsets.

So I'm guessing a sequence of linear functions converges uniformly on a compact set iff it converges
uniformly on the closed convex balanced envelope?

Terminology: A set is stb "absolutely convex" or "disked" if it is convex and balanced
Mathlib considers absolutely convex in `Analysis/LocallyConvex/AbsConvex`
