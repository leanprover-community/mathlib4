# Continuous (star-)algebra equivalences between continuous endomorphisms are (isometrically) inner

This file shows that continuous (star-)algebra equivalences between continuous endomorphisms are
(isometrically) inner.
See `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/GeneralLinearGroup/AlgEquiv.lean` for the non-continuous version.
The proof follows the same idea as the non-continuous version.

### TODO:
- when `V = W`, we can state that the group homomorphism
  `(V →L[𝕜] V)ˣ →* ((V →L[𝕜] V) ≃A[𝕜] (V →L[𝕜] V))` is surjective,
  see `Module.End.mulSemiringActionToAlgEquiv_conjAct_surjective` for the non-continuous
  version of this.

    (f : (V →L[𝕜] V) ≃A[𝕜] (W →L[𝕜] W)) :
    ∃ U : V ≃L[𝕜] W, f = U.conjContinuousAlgEquiv := by
  /- The proof goes as follows:
    We want to show the existence of a continuous linear equivalence `U : V ≃L[𝕜] W` such that
    `f A (U x) = U (A x)` for all `A : V →L[𝕜] V` and `x : V`.
    Assume nontriviality of `V`, and let `(u : V) ≠ 0`. Let `v` be a strong dual on `V` such that
    `v u ≠ 0` (exists since it has a separating dual).
    Let `z : W` such that `f (smulRight v u) z ≠ 0`.
    Then we construct a bijective continuous linear map `T : V →L[𝕜] W`
    given by `x ↦ f (smulRight v x) z` and so satisfies `T (A x) = f A (T x)` for all
    `A : V →L[𝕜] V` and `x : V`. So it remains to show that this map has a continuous inverse.
    Let `d` be a strong dual on `W` such that `d ((f (smulRight v u)) z) = 1` (exists since it has
    a separating dual).
    We then construct a right-inverse continuous linear map `T' : W →L[𝕜] V` given by
    `x ↦ f.symm (smulRight d x) u`.
    And so it follows that `T` is also a continuous linear equivalence. -/
