# The weak operator topology

This file defines a type copy of `E →L[𝕜] F` (where `F` is a normed space) which is
endowed with the weak operator topology (WOT) rather than the topology induced by the operator norm.
The WOT is defined as the coarsest topology such that the functional `fun A => y (A x)` is
continuous for any `x : E` and `y : NormedSpace.Dual 𝕜 F`. Equivalently, a function `f` tends to
`A : E →WOT[𝕜] F` along filter `l` iff `y (f a x)` tends to `y (A x)` along the same filter.

Basic non-topological properties of `E →L[𝕜] F` (such as the module structure) are copied over to
the type copy.

We also prove that the WOT is induced by the family of seminorms `‖y (A x)‖` for `x : E` and
`y : NormedSpace.Dual 𝕜 F`.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMapWOT 𝕜 E F`: The type copy of `E →L[𝕜] F` endowed with the weak operator
  topology.
* `ContinuousLinearMapWOT.tendsto_iff_forall_dual_apply_tendsto`: a function `f` tends to
  `A : E →WOT[𝕜] F` along filter `l` iff `y ((f a) x)` tends to `y (A x)` along the same filter.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.toWOT`: the inclusion map from `E →L[𝕜] F` to the type copy
* `ContinuousLinearMap.continuous_toWOT`: the inclusion map is continuous, i.e. the WOT is coarser
  than the norm topology.
* `ContinuousLinearMapWOT.withSeminorms`: the WOT is induced by the family of seminorms
  `‖y (A x)‖` for `x : E` and `y : NormedSpace.Dual 𝕜 F`.

## Notation

* The type copy of `E →L[𝕜] F` endowed with the weak operator topology is denoted by
  `E →WOT[𝕜] F`.
* We locally use the notation `F⋆` for `NormedSpace.Dual 𝕜 F`.

## Implementation notes

In the literature, the WOT is only defined on maps between Banach spaces. Here, we generalize this
a bit to `E →L[𝕜] F` where `F` is an normed space, and `E` actually only needs to be a vector
space with some topology for most results in this file.
