# Normed spaces `Π (n : ℕ), E n`

When `E n` are topological spaces, the space `Π (n : ℕ), E n` is naturally a topological space
(with the product topology). When `E n` are uniform spaces, it also inherits a uniform structure.
However, it does not inherit a canonical metric space structure of the `E n`. Nevertheless, one
can put a noncanonical metric space structure (or rather, several of them).
This is handled in `Mathlib/Topology/MetricSpace/PiNat.lean`.
Here, we extend the result to the normed additive group structure.

It is highly non-canonical, though, and therefore not registered as a global instance.
