# Hofer's lemma

This is an elementary lemma about complete metric spaces. It is motivated by an
application to the bubbling-off analysis for holomorphic curves in symplectic topology.
We are *very* far away from having these applications, but the proof here is a nice
example of a proof needing to construct a sequence by induction in the middle of the proof.
