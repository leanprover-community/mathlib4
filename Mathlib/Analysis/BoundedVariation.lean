# Almost everywhere differentiability of functions with locally bounded variation

In this file we show that a bounded variation function is differentiable almost everywhere.
This implies that Lipschitz functions from the real line into finite-dimensional vector space
are also differentiable almost everywhere.

## Main definitions and results

* `LocallyBoundedVariationOn.ae_differentiableWithinAt` shows that a bounded variation
  function into a finite dimensional real vector space is differentiable almost everywhere.
* `LipschitzOnWith.ae_differentiableWithinAt` is the same result for Lipschitz functions.

We also give several variations around these results.
