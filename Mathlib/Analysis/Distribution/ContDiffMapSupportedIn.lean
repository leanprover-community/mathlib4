# Continuously differentiable functions supported in a given compact

This file develops the basic theory of bundled `n`-times continuously differentiable functions
with support contained in a given compact.

Given `n : ℕ∞` and a compact subset `K` of a normed space `E`, we consider the type of bundled
functions `f : E → F` (where `F` is a normed vector space) such that:

- `f` is `n`-times continuously differentiable: `ContDiff ℝ n f`.
- `f` vanishes outside of a compact: `EqOn f 0 Kᶜ`.

The main reason this exists as a bundled type is to be endowed with its natural locally convex
topology (namely, uniform convergence of `f` and its derivative up to order `n`).
Taking the locally convex inductive limit of these as `K` yields the natural topology on test
functions, used to define distributions. While most of distribution theory cares only about `C^∞`
functions, we also want to endow the space of `C^n` test functions with its natural topology.
Indeed, distributions of order less than `n` are precisely those which extend continuously to this
larger space of test functions.

## Main definitions

- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E F n K`: the type of `n`-times continuously differentiable
  functions `E → F` which vanish outside of `K`.
- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.iteratedFDerivₗ'`: wrapper as a `𝕜`-linear maps for `iteratedFDeriv` on
  `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E F n K`, as a map into
  `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E (E [×i]→L[ℝ] F) (n-i) K`.

## Main statements

- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.instIsUniformAddGroup` and
  `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.instLocallyConvexSpace`: `ContDiffMapSupportedIn` is a locally convex
  topological vector space.

## Notation

- `𝓓^{n}_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of `n`-times continuously differentiable functions `E → F`
  which vanish outside of `K`.
- `𝓓_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions `E → F`
  which vanish outside of `K`, i.e. `𝓓^{⊤}_{K}(E, F)`.

## Implementation details

The technical choice of spelling `EqOn f 0 Kᶜ` in the definition, as opposed to `tsupport f ⊆ K`
is to make replacing `f` by zero outside of `K` easier.
