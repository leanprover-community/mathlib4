# Continuously differentiable functions supported in a compact

This file develops the basic theory of `n`-times continuously differentiable functions with support
contained in a given compact.

Given `n : ‚Ñï‚àû`and a compact `K` of a normed space `E`, we consider the type of functions `f : E ‚Üí F`
(where `F` is a normed vector space) such that:

- `f` is `n`-times continuously differentiable: `ContDiff ‚Ñù n f`.
- `f` vanishes outside of a compact: `EqOn f 0 K·∂ú`.

## Main definitions

- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E F n K`: the type of `n`-times continuously differentiable
  functions `E ‚Üí F` which vanish outside of `K`.

## Notation

- `ùìì^{n}_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of `n`-times continuously differentiable functions `E ‚Üí F`
  which vanish outside of `K`.
- `ùìì_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions `E ‚Üí F`
  which vanish outside of `K`, i.e. `ùìì^{‚ä§}_{K}(E, F)`.

## Implementation details

Thes technical choice of spelling `EqOn f 0 K·∂ú` as opposed to `support f = K` is to make the
development somewhat easier.
