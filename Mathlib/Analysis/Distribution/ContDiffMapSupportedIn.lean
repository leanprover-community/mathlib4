# Continuously differentiable functions supported in a given compact

This file develops the basic theory of bundled `n`-times continuously differentiable functions
with support contained in a given compact.

Given `n : ‚Ñï‚àû` and a compact subset `K` of a normed space `E`, we consider the type of bundled
functions `f : E ‚Üí F` (where `F` is a normed vector space) such that:

- `f` is `n`-times continuously differentiable: `ContDiff ‚Ñù n f`.
- `f` vanishes outside of a compact: `EqOn f 0 K·∂ú`.

We define it as a bundled structure so as to endow it with the topology required to make it a √π
subspace of the space of test functions.

## Main definitions

- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E F n K`: the type of `n`-times continuously differentiable
  functions `E ‚Üí F` which vanish outside of `K`.
- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.iteratedFDeriv‚Çó'`: wrapper as a `ùïú`-linear maps for `iteratedFDeriv` on
  `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E F n K`, as a map into `ContDiffMapSupportedIn E (E [√ói]‚ÜíL[‚Ñù] F) n-i K`.

## Main statements

- `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.instIsUniformAddGroup` and
  `ContDiffMapSupportedIn.instLocallyConvexSpace`: `ContDiffMapSupportedIn` is a locally convex
  topological vector space.

## Notation

- `ùìì^{n}_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of `n`-times continuously differentiable functions `E ‚Üí F`
  which vanish outside of `K`.
- `ùìì_{K}(E, F)`:  the space of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions `E ‚Üí F`
  which vanish outside of `K`, i.e. `ùìì^{‚ä§}_{K}(E, F)`.

## Implementation details

The technical choice of spelling `EqOn f 0 K·∂ú` in the definition, as opposed to `tsupport f ‚äÜ K`
is to make replacing `f` by zero outside of `K` easier.
