# Absolutely monotone functions

A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is *absolutely monotone* on a set `s` if its iterated derivatives are all
nonnegative on `s`.

## Main definitions

* `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn` — there exists a Taylor series for `f` on `s` with nonnegative terms at
  each point of `s`.

## Main results

* `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.contDiffOn` — the function is `C^∞` on `s`.
* `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.of_contDiff` — a globally `C^∞` function with nonnegative iterated
  derivatives on `s` is absolutely monotone on `s`.
* `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.add` — closure under addition.
* `AbsolutelyMonotoneOn.smul` — closure under nonnegative scalar multiplication.

## Implementation

The precise definition is phrased via the existence of a Taylor series with nonnegative terms
(`HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn`) rather than via `iteratedDerivWithin`. This avoids forcing a
`UniqueDiffOn s` hypothesis on every result: without `UniqueDiffOn`, "the" iterated derivative
within `s` is not canonical, but the existence of a Taylor series is intrinsic to `f` and `s`.
When `s` does satisfy `UniqueDiffOn`, the condition reduces to `f` being `C^∞` on `s` with every
iterated derivative within `s` nonnegative.

/-- A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is **absolutely monotone on a set `s`** if, heuristically, all
iterated derivatives of `f` on `s` are nonnegative. For technical reasons related to unique
differentiability, the precise definition is phrased as the existence of a Taylor series for
`f` on `s` whose `n`th term, evaluated at the all-ones tuple, is nonnegative for every `n` and
every `x ∈ s`. See the module docstring for the equivalence under `UniqueDiffOn`. -/
