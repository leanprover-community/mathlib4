# Extending differentiability to the boundary

We investigate how differentiable functions inside a set extend to differentiable functions
on the boundary. For this, it suffices that the function and its derivative admit limits there.
A general version of this statement is given in `has_fderiv_at_boundary_of_tendsto_fderiv`.

One-dimensional versions, in which one wants to obtain differentiability at the left endpoint or
the right endpoint of an interval, are given in
`has_deriv_at_interval_left_endpoint_of_tendsto_deriv` and
`has_deriv_at_interval_right_endpoint_of_tendsto_deriv`. These versions are formulated in terms
of the one-dimensional derivative `deriv ℝ f`.

/-- If a function `f` is differentiable in a convex open set and continuous on its closure, and its
derivative converges to a limit `f'` at a point on the boundary, then `f` is differentiable there
with derivative `f'`. -/

      `closure s`, where `ε` is an arbitrary positive constant. By continuity of the functions, it
      suffices to prove this for nearby points inside `s`. In a neighborhood of `x`, the derivative
      of `f` is arbitrarily close to `f'` by assumption. The mean value inequality completes the
      proof. -/
