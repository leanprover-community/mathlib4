# Derivatives of operations on continuous multilinear maps

In this file,

- `ι` is an index type (`Fin n` in many applications);
- `E`, `F i`, `G i`, `H`, are normed spaces for each `i : ι`;
- `f x` is a continuous multilinear map from `Π i, G i` to `H`, depending on a parameter `x : E`;
- for each `i : ι`, `g i x` is a continuous linear map `F i → G i`, depending on a parameter `x : E`;

Given this data, for each `x` we can define a continuous multilinear map from `Π i, F i` to `H`
given by `(f x).compContinuousLinearMap (fun i ↦ g i x) v = f x (fun i ↦ g i x (v i))`.

As a map between functional spaces,
`ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMap` is multilinear in `(f; g i)`.
Thus its derivative with respect to each map (`f` or `g i`)
is given by substituting `f'` or `g' i` instead of `f` or `g i`
in `(f x).compContinuousLinearMap (fun i ↦ g i x)`,
and the full differential is given by the sum of these terms.

In terms of bundled maps, the derivative with respect to `f`
is given by `ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMapL`
and the sum of terms that represent the derivatives with respect to `g i`
is given by `ContinuousMultilinearMap.fderivCompContinuousLinearMap`.

All statements in the first section are claiming this, for various notions of differentiation. 
The second section deduces the corresponding differentiability results when `ι` is finite.
