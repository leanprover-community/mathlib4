# The mean value inequality and equalities

In this file we prove the following facts:

* `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_deriv_le` : if `f` is differentiable on a convex set `s`
  and the norm of its derivative is bounded by `C`, then `f` is Lipschitz continuous on `s` with
  constant `C`; also a variant in which what is bounded by `C` is the norm of the difference of the
  derivative from a fixed linear map. This lemma and its versions are formulated using `RCLike`,
  so they work both for real and complex derivatives.

* `image_le_of*`, `image_norm_le_of_*` : several similar lemmas deducing `f x ≤ B x` or
  `‖f x‖ ≤ B x` from upper estimates on `f'` or `‖f'‖`, respectively. These lemmas differ by
  their assumptions:

  * `of_liminf_*` lemmas assume that limit inferior of some ratio is less than `B' x`;
  * `of_deriv_right_*`, `of_norm_deriv_right_*` lemmas assume that the right derivative
    or its norm is less than `B' x`;
  * `of_*_lt_*` lemmas assume a strict inequality whenever `f x = B x` or `‖f x‖ = B x`;
  * `of_*_le_*` lemmas assume a non-strict inequality everywhere on `[a, b)`;
  * name of a lemma ends with `'` if (1) it assumes that `B` is continuous on `[a, b]`
    and has a right derivative at every point of `[a, b)`, and (2) the lemma has
    a counterpart assuming that `B` is differentiable everywhere on `ℝ`

* `norm_image_sub_le_*_segment` : if derivative of `f` on `[a, b]` is bounded above
  by a constant `C`, then `‖f x - f a‖ ≤ C * ‖x - a‖`; several versions deal with
  right derivative and derivative within `[a, b]` (`HasDerivWithinAt` or `derivWithin`).

* `Convex.is_const_of_fderivWithin_eq_zero` : if a function has derivative `0` on a convex set `s`,
  then it is a constant on `s`.

* `exists_ratio_hasDerivAt_eq_ratio_slope` and `exists_ratio_deriv_eq_ratio_slope` :
  Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem.

* `exists_hasDerivAt_eq_slope` and `exists_deriv_eq_slope` : Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem.

* `domain_mvt` : Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, applied to a segment in a convex domain.

* `Convex.image_sub_lt_mul_sub_of_deriv_lt`, `Convex.mul_sub_lt_image_sub_of_lt_deriv`,
  `Convex.image_sub_le_mul_sub_of_deriv_le`, `Convex.mul_sub_le_image_sub_of_le_deriv`,
  if `∀ x, C (</≤/>/≥) (f' x)`, then `C * (y - x) (</≤/>/≥) (f y - f x)` whenever `x < y`.

* `monotoneOn_of_deriv_nonneg`, `antitoneOn_of_deriv_nonpos`,
  `strictMono_of_deriv_pos`, `strictAnti_of_deriv_neg` :
  if the derivative of a function is non-negative/non-positive/positive/negative, then
  the function is monotone/antitone/strictly monotone/strictly monotonically
  decreasing.

* `convexOn_of_deriv`, `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg` : if the derivative of a function
  is increasing or its second derivative is nonnegative, then the original function is convex.

* `hasStrictFDerivAt_of_hasFDerivAt_of_continuousAt` : a C^1 function over the reals is
  strictly differentiable. (This is a corollary of the mean value inequality.)

### Vector-valued functions `f : E → G`

Theorems in this section work both for real and complex differentiable functions. We use assumptions
`[NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] [IsRCLikeNormedField 𝕜] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 G]` to
achieve this result. For the domain `E` we also assume `[NormedSpace ℝ E]` to have a notion
of a `Convex` set. -/

### Vector-valued functions `f : E → F`. Strict differentiability.

A `C^1` function is strictly differentiable, when the field is `ℝ` or `ℂ`. This follows from the
mean value inequality on balls, which is a particular case of the above results after restricting
the scalars to `ℝ`. Note that it does not make sense to talk of a convex set over `ℂ`, but balls
make sense and are enough. Many formulations of the mean value inequality could be generalized to
balls over `ℝ` or `ℂ`. For now, we only include the ones that we need.
