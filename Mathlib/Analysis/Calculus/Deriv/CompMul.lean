# Derivative of `x ↦ f (cx)`

In this file we prove that the derivative of `fun x ↦ f (c * x)`
equals `c` times the derivative of `f` evaluated at `c * x`.

Since Mathlib uses `0` as the fallback value for the derivatives whenever they are undefined,
the theorems in this file require neither differentiability of `f`,
nor assumptions like `UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x`.
