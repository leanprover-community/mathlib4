# Inverse function theorem - the easy half

In this file we prove that `g' (f x) = (f' x)⁻¹` provided that `f` is strictly differentiable at
`x`, `f' x ≠ 0`, and `g` is a local left inverse of `f` that is continuous at `f x`. This is the
easy half of the inverse function theorem: the harder half states that `g` exists.

For a more detailed overview of one-dimensional derivatives in mathlib, see the module docstring of
`Analysis/Calculus/Deriv/Basic`.
