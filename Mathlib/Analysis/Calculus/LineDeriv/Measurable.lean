/-! # Measurability of the line derivative

We prove in `measurable_lineDeriv` that the line derivative of a function (with respect to a
locally compact scalar field) is measurable, provided the function is continuous.

In `measurable_lineDeriv_uncurry`, assuming additionally that the source space is second countable,
we show that `(x, v) ↦ lineDeriv 𝕜 f x v` is also measurable.

An assumption such as continuity is necessary, as otherwise one could alternate in a non-measurable
way between differentiable and non-differentiable functions along the various lines
directed by `v`.

/-!
Measurability of the line derivative `lineDeriv 𝕜 f x v` when varying both `x` and `v`. For this,
we need an additional second countability assumption on `E` to make sure that open sets are
measurable in `E × E`.
