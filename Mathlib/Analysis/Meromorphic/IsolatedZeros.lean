# Principles of Isolated Zeros and Identity Principles for Meromorphic Functions

In line with results in `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.IsolatedZeros` and
`Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.Uniqueness`, this file establishes principles of isolated zeros and
identity principles for meromorphic functions.

Compared to the results for analytic functions, the principles established here are a little more
complicated to state. This is because meromorphic functions can be modified at will along discrete
subsets and still remain meromorphic.

## Principles of Isolated Zeros
-/

/--
The principle of isolated zeros: If `f` is meromorphic at `x`, then `f` vanishes eventually in a
punctured neighborhood of `x` iff it vanishes frequently in punctured neighborhoods.

See `AnalyticAt.frequently_zero_iff_eventually_zero` for a stronger result in the analytic case.

  ⟨hf.eventually_eq_zero_or_eventually_ne_zero.resolve_right, fun h ↦ h.frequently⟩

/--
Variant of the principle of isolated zeros: Let `U` be a subset of `𝕜` and assume that `x ∈ U` is
not an isolated point of `U`. If a function `f` is meromorphic at `x` and vanishes along a subset
that is codiscrete within `U`, then `f` vanishes in a punctured neighbourhood of `f`.

For a typical application, let `U` be a path in the complex plane and let `x` be one of the end
points. If `f` is meromorphic at `x` and vanishes on `U`, then it will vanish in a punctured
neighbourhood of `x`, which intersects `U` non-trivally but is not contained in `U`.

The assumption that `x` is not an isolated point of `U` is expressed as `AccPt x (𝓟 U)`. See
`accPt_iff_frequently` and `accPt_iff_frequently_nhdsNE` for useful reformulations.

## Identity Principles

/--
Formulation of `MeromorphicAt.frequently_zero_iff_eventuallyEq_zero` as an identity principle: If
`f` and `g` are meromorphic at `x`, then `f` and `g` agree eventually in a punctured neighborhood of
`x` iff they agree at points arbitrarily close to (but different from) `x`.

Formulation of `MeromorphicAt.eventuallyEq_zero_nhdsNE_of_eventuallyEq_zero_codiscreteWithin` as an

`U`. If function `f` and `g` are meromorphic at `x` and agree along a subset that is codiscrete
within `U`, then `f` and `g` agree in a punctured neighbourhood of `f`.
