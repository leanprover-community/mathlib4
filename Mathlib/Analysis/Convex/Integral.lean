# Jensen's inequality for integrals

In this file we prove several forms of Jensen's inequality for integrals.

- for convex sets: `Convex.average_mem`, `Convex.set_average_mem`, `Convex.integral_mem`;

- for convex functions: `ConvexOn.average_mem_epigraph`, `ConvexOn.map_average_le`,
  `ConvexOn.set_average_mem_epigraph`, `ConvexOn.map_set_average_le`, `ConvexOn.map_integral_le`;

- for strictly convex sets: `StrictConvex.ae_eq_const_or_average_mem_interior`;

- for a closed ball in a strictly convex normed space:
  `ae_eq_const_or_norm_integral_lt_of_norm_le_const`;

- for strictly convex functions: `StrictConvexOn.ae_eq_const_or_map_average_lt`.

## TODO

- Use a typeclass for strict convexity of a closed ball.

/-- If `E` is a strictly convex normed space and `f : α → E` is a function such that `‖f x‖ ≤ C`
a.e. on a set `t` of finite measure, then either this function is a.e. equal to its average value on
`t`, or the norm of its integral over `t` is strictly less than `μ.real t * C`. -/
