# Convex analysis

This subfolder is destined to contain convexity results that require a norm or an inner product.

See the `Mathlib.Geometry.Convex` folder for the results that do not need a norm or an inner product.

## Topics

The topics currently covered are:
* Strongly convex functions, uniformly convex functions
* The product of convex functions is convex
* Continuity of convex functions
* Functions with positive second derivative are convex
* Null-measurability of convex sets
* Minkowski functional, gauge
* Strictly convex spaces
* Uniformly convex spaces
* Ample sets
