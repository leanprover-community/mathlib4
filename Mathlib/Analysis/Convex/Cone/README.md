# Topological and analytic theory of convex cones

This subfolder is destined to contain results about convex cones that require a topology, a norm or
an inner product.

See the `Mathlib.Geometry.Convex.Cone` folder for the purely algebraic theory of convex cones.

## Topics

The convex cone topics currently covered are:
* Proper cone
* Dual cone along a continuous bilinear pairing
* Inner dual cone
* Farkas' lemma, Hahn-Banach separation, hyperplane separation, double dual of a proper cone
* M. Riesz extension theorem
