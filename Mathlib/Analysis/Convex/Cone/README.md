# Theory of convex cones in normed spaces

This subfolder is destined to contain results about convex cones that require a norm or an inner product.

See the `Mathlib.Geometry.Convex.Cone` folder for the results that do not need a norm nor an inner product.

## Topics

The convex cone topics currently covered are:
* Inner dual cone
* Farkas' lemma, Hahn-Banach separation, hyperplane separation, double dual of a proper cone
* M. Riesz extension theorem
