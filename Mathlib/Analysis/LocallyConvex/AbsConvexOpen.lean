# Absolutely convex open sets

A set `s` in a commutative monoid `E` equipped with a topology is said to be an absolutely convex
open set if it is absolutely convex and open. When `E` is a topological additive group, the topology
coincides with the topology induced by the family of seminorms arising as gauges of absolutely
convex open neighborhoods of zero.

## Main definitions

* `AbsConvexOpenSets`: sets which are absolutely convex and open
* `gaugeSeminormFamily`: the seminorm family induced by all open absolutely convex neighborhoods
  of zero.

## Main statements

* `with_gaugeSeminormFamily`: the topology of a locally convex space is induced by the family
  `gaugeSeminormFamily`.
