# Von Neumann Mean Ergodic Theorem in a Hilbert Space

In this file we prove the von Neumann Mean Ergodic Theorem for an operator in a Hilbert space.
It says that for a contracting linear self-map `f : E →ₗ[𝕜] E` of a Hilbert space,
the Birkhoff averages
```
birkhoffAverage 𝕜 f id N x = (N : 𝕜)⁻¹ • ∑ n ∈ Finset.range N, f^[n] x
```
converge to the orthogonal projection of `x` to the subspace of fixed points of `f`,
see `ContinuousLinearMap.tendsto_birkhoffAverage_orthogonalProjection`.

/-- **Von Neumann Mean Ergodic Theorem**, a version for a normed space.

Let `f : E → E` be a contracting linear self-map of a normed space.
Let `S` be the subspace of fixed points of `f`.
Let `g : E → S` be a continuous linear projection, `g|_S=id`.
If the range of `f - id` is dense in the kernel of `g`,
then for each `x`, the Birkhoff averages
```
birkhoffAverage 𝕜 f id N x = (N : 𝕜)⁻¹ • ∑ n ∈ Finset.range N, f^[n] x
```
converge to `g x` as `N → ∞`.

Usually, this fact is not formulated as a separate lemma.
I chose to do it in order to isolate parts of the proof that do not rely
on the inner product space structure.
