/-! # Continuity of the continuous functional calculus in each variable

The continuous functional calculus is a map which takes a pair `a : A` (`A` is a C⋆-algebra) and
a function `f : C(spectrum R a, R)` where `a` satisfies some predicate `p`, depending on `R` and
returns another element of the algebra `A`. This is the map `cfcHom`. The class
`ContinuousFunctionalCalculus` declares that `cfcHom` is a continuous map from `C(spectrum R a, R)`
to `A`. However, users generally interact with the continuous functional calculus through `cfc`,
which operates on bare functions `f : R → R` instead and takes a junk value when `f` is not
continuous on the spectrum of `a`.  In this file we provide some lemma concerning the continuity
of `cfc`, subject to natural hypotheses.

However, the continuous functional calculus is *also* continuous in the variable `a`, but there
are some conditions that must be satisfied. In particular, given a function `f : R → R` the map
`a ↦ cfc f a` is continuous so long as `a` varies over a collection of elements satisfying the
predicate `p` and their spectra are collectively contained in a compact set on which `f` is
continuous. Moreover, it is required that the continuous functional calculus be the isometric
variant.

Under the assumption of `IsometricContinuousFunctionalCalculus`, we show that the continuous
functional calculus is Lipschitz with constant 1 in the variable `f : R →ᵤ[{spectrum R a}] R`
on the set of functions which are continuous on the spectrum of `a`. Combining this with the
continuity of the continuous functional calculus in the variable `a`, we obtain a joint continuity
result for `cfc` in both variables.

Finally, all of this is developed for both the unital and non-unital functional calculi.
The continuity results in the function variable are valid for all scalar rings, but the continuity
results in the variable `a` come in two flavors: those for `RCLike 𝕜` and those for `ℝ≥0`.

## Main results


+ `tendsto_cfc_fun`: If `F : X → R → R` tends to `f : R → R` uniformly on the spectrum of `a`, and
  all these functions are continuous on the spectrum, then `fun x ↦ cfc (F x) a` tends
  to `cfc f a`.
+ `Filter.Tendsto.cfc`: If `f : 𝕜 → 𝕜` is continuous on a compact set `s` and `a : X → A` tends to
  `a₀ : A` along a filter `l` (such that eventually `a x` satisfies the predicate `p` associated to
  `𝕜` and has spectrum contained in `s`, as does `a₀`), then `fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)` tends to
  `cfc f a₀`.
+ `lipschitzOnWith_cfc_fun`: The function `f ↦ cfc f a` is Lipschitz with constant with constant 1
  with respect to supremum metric (on `R →ᵤ[{spectrum R a}] R`) on those functions which are
  continuous on the spectrum.
+ `continuousOn_cfc`: For `f : 𝕜 → 𝕜` continuous on a compact set `s`, `cfc f` is continuous on the
  set of `a : A` satisfying the predicate `p` (associated to `𝕜`) and whose `𝕜`-spectrum is
  contained in `s`.
+ `continuousOn_cfc_setProd`: Let `s : Set 𝕜` be a compact set and consider pairs
  `(f, a) : (𝕜 → 𝕜) × A` where `f` is continuous on `s` and `spectrum 𝕜 a ⊆ s` and `a` satisfies
  the predicate `p a` for the continuous functional calculus. Then `cfc` is jointly continuous in
  both variables (i.e., continuous in its uncurried form) on this set of pairs when the function
  space is equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on `s`.
+ Versions of all of the above for non-unital algebras, and versions over `ℝ≥0` as well.
