# Measure preserving maps

We say that `f : α → β` is a measure preserving map w.r.t. measures `μ : Measure α` and
`ν : Measure β` if `f` is measurable and `map f μ = ν`. In this file we define the predicate
`MeasureTheory.MeasurePreserving` and prove its basic properties.

We use the term "measure preserving" because in many applications `α = β` and `μ = ν`.
