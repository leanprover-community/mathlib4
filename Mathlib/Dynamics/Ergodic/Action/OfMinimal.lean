# Ergodicity from minimality

In this file we prove that the left shift `(a * ¬∑)` on a compact topological group `G`
is ergodic with respect to the Haar measure if and only if its minimal,
i.e., the powers `a ^ n` are dense in `G`.

The proof of the more difficult "if minimal, then ergodic" implication
is based on the ergodicity of the left action of a group on itself
and the following fact that we prove in `ergodic_smul_of_denseRange_pow` below:

If a monoid `M` continuously acts on an R‚ÇÅ topological space `X`,
`g` is an element of `M such that its natural powers are dense in `M`,
and `Œº` is a finite inner regular measure on `X` which is ergodic with respect to the action of `M`,
then the scalar multiplication by `g` is an ergodic map.

We also prove that a continuous monoid homomorphism `f : G ‚Üí* G` is ergodic,
if it is surjective and the preimages of `1` under iterations of `f` are dense in the group.
This theorem applies, e.g., to the map `z ‚Ü¶ n ‚Ä¢ z` on the additive circle or a torus.
