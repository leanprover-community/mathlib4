# Radon-Nikodym derivative of invariant measures

Given two finite invariant measures of a self-map,
we prove that their singular parts, their absolutely continuous parts,
and their Radon-Nikodym derivatives are invariant too.

For the first two theorems, we only assume that one of the measures is finite
and the other is σ-finite.

## TODO

It isn't clear if the finiteness assumptions are optimal in this file.
We should either weaken them, or describe an example showing that it's impossible.
