# Symbolic dynamics on cancellative monoids

This file develops a minimal API for symbolic dynamics over an arbitrary
**right-cancellative monoid** `G` (`[Monoid G] [IsRightCancelMul G]`).

Given a finite alphabet `A`, the ambient configuration space is the set of
functions `G → A`, endowed with the product topology. We define the
right-translation action, cylinders, finite patterns, their occurrences,
forbidden sets, and subshifts (closed, shift-invariant subsets). Basic
topological facts (e.g. cylinders are clopen, occurrence sets are clopen,
forbidden sets are closed) are proved under discreteness assumptions on
the alphabet.

The development is generic for right-cancellative monoids. This covers both
groups (the standard setting of symbolic dynamics) and more general monoids
where cancellation holds but inverses may not exist. Geometry specific to
`ℤ^d` (boxes/cubes and the box-based entropy) is deferred to a separate
specialization.

## Why cancellativity?

Some constructions, such as translating a finite pattern to occur at a point `v`,
require solving equations of the form `w * v = h`. For this to have a unique
solution `w` given `h` and `v`, we assume **right-cancellation**:
if `a * v = b * v` then `a = b`. This allows us to define
`patternToConfig` (which extends a pattern into a configuration
using the default value of `A`) without using inverses,
so that the theory works not only for groups but also for cancellative monoids.

## Main definitions

* `mulShift g x` — right translation: in additive notation `(shift v x) u = x (u + v)`;
          multiplicative notation `(mulShift g x) h = x (h * g)`.
* `cylinder U x` — configurations agreeing with `x` on a finite set `U ⊆ G`.
* `pattern A G` — finite support together with values on that support.
* `pattern.occursIn p x g` — occurrence of `p` in `x` at translate `g`.
* `forbids F` — configurations avoiding every pattern in `F`.
* `subshift A G` — closed, shift-invariant subsets of the full shift.
* `subshft_from_forbidden F` — the subshift defined by forbidding a family of patterns.
* `subshift_of_finite_type F` — a subshift of finite type defined by a finite set of
forbidden patterns.
* `languageOn X U` — the set of patterns of shape `U` obtained by restricting some `x ∈ X`.

## Conventions

We use a **right** action of `G` on configurations:
`(shift v x) u = x (u + v)`.
In multiplicative notation:
`(mulShift g x) h = x (h * g)`.

## Design choice: ambient vs. inner (subshift-relative) viewpoint

All core notions (shift, cylinder, occurrence, language, …) are defined **in the
ambient full shift** `(G → A)`. A subshift is then a closed, invariant subset,
bundled as `subshift A G`. Working inside a subshift is done by restriction.

**Motivation.**
If cylinders and shifts were defined only *inside* a subshift, local ergonomics
would improve but global operations would become awkward. For instance, to prove
that for finite shape `U`:

`languageOn (X ∪ Y) U = languageOn X U ∪ languageOn Y U,`

one must eventually move both sides to the ambient pattern type. Similar issues
arise for intersections, factors, and products. By contrast, with ambient
definitions these set-theoretic identities are tautological.
Thus the file develops the theory ambiently, and subshifts reuse it by restriction.

**Working inside a subshift.**
For `Y : subshift A G`, cylinders and occurrence sets *inside `Y`* are simply
preimages of the ambient ones under the inclusion `Y → (G → A)`. For example:

`{ y : Y | ∀ i ∈ U, (y : G → A) i = (x : G → A) i } = (Subtype.val) ⁻¹' (cylinder U (x : G → A)).`

Shift invariance guarantees that the ambient shift restricts to `Y`.

**Ergonomics.**
Thin wrappers (e.g. `Subshift.shift`, `Subshift.cylinder`, `Subshift.languageOn`)
may be added for convenience. They introduce no new theory and unfold to the
ambient definitions.

## Namespacing policy

All ambient definitions live under the namespace `SymbolicDynamics.FullShift`.
If inner, subshift-relative wrappers are provided, they will be placed in the
subnamespace `SymbolicDynamics.Subshift`. This separation avoids name clashes
between the two viewpoints, since both may naturally want to reuse names like
`cylinder`, `shift`, `occursAt`, or `languageOn`.

## Implementation notes

* Openness/closedness results for cylinders and occurrence sets use
  `[DiscreteTopology A]`. Closedness proofs that enumerate values additionally
  require `[Fintype A]`, `[DecidableEq A]`, and `[DecidableEq G]` (for `Finset`
  manipulations and `Function.update`).

/-- The **right-translation shift** on configurations.

We call *configuration* an element of `G → A`.

Given a configuration `x : G → A` and an element `g : G` of the group, the shifted configuration
`mulShift g x` is defined by `(mulShift g x) h = x (h * g)`.

Intuitively, this moves the whole configuration "in the direction of `g`": the value
at position `h` in the shifted configuration is the value that was at position
`h * g` in the original one.

For example, if `G = ℤ` (with addition) and `A = {0,1}`, then
`mulShift 1 x` is the sequence obtained from `x` by shifting every symbol one
step to the left. -/

/-- A *cylinder set* is the set of all configurations that agree with a given
reference configuration `x` on a fixed finite subset `U` of the index set `G`.

The set `U` is called the *support* of the cylinder.

Intuitively, cylinders specify the "letters" on finitely many coordinates, while
leaving all other coordinates free. For example, in the full shift `{0,1}^ℤ`,
the cylinder determined by `U = {0,1}` and `x 0 = 1, x 1 = 0` consists of all
bi-infinite sequences of `0`s and `1`s whose entries on positions `0` and `1`
respectively are `1` and `0`.

This is a standard way to construct subshifts:
`subshift_from_forbidden F` consists of all configurations `x : G → A` in which no pattern
`p ∈ F` occurs at any position.

Formally:
* the carrier is `forbids F` (configurations avoiding `F`),
* it is closed because each occurrence set is open, and

/-- An equivalence between patterns with fixed support and functions on that support.

Concretely, `fixedSupport A G U` is the subtype of patterns whose support is
exactly `U`. Such a pattern is determined uniquely by its values on `U`,
i.e. by a function `U → A`. This equivalence makes that identification precise:

* `toFun` sends a fixed-support pattern to the function recording its values,
* `invFun` rebuilds the pattern from a function on `U`.

This shows immediately that `fixedSupport A G U` is finite whenever `U` is. -/
