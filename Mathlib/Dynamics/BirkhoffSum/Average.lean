# Birkhoff average

In this file we define `birkhoffAverage f g n x` to be
$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}g(f^{[k]}(x)),
$$
where `f : α → α` is a self-map on some type `α`,
`g : α → M` is a function from `α` to a module over a division semiring `R`,
and `R` is used to formalize division by `n` as `(n : R)⁻¹ • _`.

While we need an auxiliary division semiring `R` to define `birkhoffAverage`,
the definition does not depend on the choice of `R`,
see `birkhoffAverage_congr_ring`.

variable (R : Type*) {α M : Type*} [DivisionSemiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]

/-- The average value of `g` on the first `n` points of the orbit of `x` under `f`,
i.e. the Birkhoff sum `∑ k in Finset.range n, g (f^[k] x)` divided by `n`.

This average appears in many ergodic theorems
which say that `(birkhoffAverage R f g · x)`
converges to the "space average" `⨍ x, g x ∂μ` as `n → ∞`.

We use an auxiliary `[DivisionSemiring R]` to define division by `n`.
However, the definition does not depend on the choice of `R`,
see `birkhoffAverage_congr_ring`. -/

/-- Birkhoff average is "almost invariant" under `f`:
the difference between `birkhoffAverage R f g n (f x)` and `birkhoffAverage R f g n x`
is equal to `(n : R)⁻¹ • (g (f^[n] x) - g x)`. -/
