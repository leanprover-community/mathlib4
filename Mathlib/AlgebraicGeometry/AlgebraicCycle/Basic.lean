# Algebraic Cycles

In this file we define algebraic cycles on a scheme `X` with coefficients in a type `R` and provide
some basic API for working with them. We define an algebraic cycle on a scheme `X` with
coefficients in a type `R` to be functions `c : X → R` whose support is locally finite.

## Implementation notes

Here we're making use of the equivalence between irreducible closed subsets of a scheme and their
generic points in order to reuse the API in `Function.locallyFinsupp`, hence the slightly
nonstandard definition.

Algebraic cycle on a scheme `X` with coefficients in a type `Z` is just a function from `X` to `Z`
with locally finite support (see the module docstring for more details).

Note: currently this is an abbrev to save some effort in duplicating API. This seems fine for now,
but be aware of this if there is ever an instance clash involving algebraic cycles.

/--
The pushforward of algebraic cycles with respect to a quasicompact morphism of schemes. The
arguments `wx` and `wy` are certain weight functions used to calculate how the weights of the
algebraic cycle should be adjusted to make the pushforward operation functorial. Typically in
applications these will be some notions of dimension or codimension. The most common notion of
dimension is `Order.height`, and the most common notion of codimension is `Order.coheight`, though
more sophisticated notions exist in the literature which are useful when sufficient
equidimensionality hypotheses cannot be assumed.
