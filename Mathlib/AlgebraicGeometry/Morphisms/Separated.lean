# Separated morphisms

A morphism of schemes is separated if its diagonal morphism is a closed immmersion.

## TODO

- Show separated is stable under composition and base change (this is immediate if
  we show that closed immersions are stable under base change).
- Show separated is local at the target.
- Show affine morphisms are separated.
