# Closed immersions of schemes

A morphism of schemes `f : X ⟶ Y` is a closed immersion if the underlying map of topological spaces
is a closed immersion and the induced morphisms of stalks are all surjective.

## Main definitions

* `IsClosedImmersion` : The property of scheme morphisms stating `f : X ⟶ Y` is a closed immersion.

## TODO

* Show closed immersions of affines are induced by surjective ring maps
* Show closed immersions are stable under pullback
* Show closed immersions are precisely the proper monomorphisms
* Define closed immersions of locally ringed spaces, where we also assume that the kernel of `O_X →
  f_*O_Y` is locally generated by sections as an `O_X`-module, and relate it to this file. See
  https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01HJ.
