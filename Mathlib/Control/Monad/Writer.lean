# Writer monads

This file introduces monads for managing immutable, appendable state.
Common applications are logging monads where the monad logs messages as the
computation progresses.

/-- Creates an instance of Monad, with an explicitly given empty and append operation.

Previously, this would have used an instance of `[Monoid ω]` as input.
In practice, however, WriterT is used for logging and creating lists so restricting to
monoids with `Mul` and `One` can make `WriterT` cumbersome to use.

This is used to derive instances for both `[EmptyCollection ω] [Append ω]` and `[Monoid ω]`.

/-- Adapt a monad stack, changing the type of its top-most environment.

This class is comparable to [Control.Lens.Magnify](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.15.4/docs/Control-Lens-Zoom.html#t:Magnify),
but does not use lenses (why would it), and is derived automatically for any transformer
implementing `MonadFunctor`.
