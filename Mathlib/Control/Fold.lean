# List folds generalized to `Traversable`

Informally, we can think of `foldl` as a special case of `traverse` where we do not care about the
reconstructed data structure and, in a state monad, we care about the final state.

The obvious way to define `foldl` would be to use the state monad but it
is nicer to reason about a more abstract interface with `foldMap` as a
primitive and `foldMap_hom` as a defining property.

```
def foldMap {α ω} [One ω] [Mul ω] (f : α → ω) : t α → ω := ...

lemma foldMap_hom (α β) [Monoid α] [Monoid β] (f : α →* β) (g : γ → α) (x : t γ) :
    f (foldMap g x) = foldMap (f ∘ g) x :=
...
```

`foldMap` uses a monoid ω to accumulate a value for every element of
a data structure and `foldMap_hom` uses a monoid homomorphism to
substitute the monoid used by `foldMap`. The two are sufficient to
define `foldl`, `foldr` and `toList`. `toList` permits the
formulation of specifications in terms of operations on lists.

Each fold function can be defined using a specialized
monoid. `toList` uses a free monoid represented as a list with
concatenation while `foldl` uses endofunctions together with function
composition.

The definition through monoids uses `traverse` together with the
applicative functor `const m` (where `m` is the monoid). As an
implementation, `const` guarantees that no resource is spent on
reconstructing the structure during traversal.

A special class could be defined for `foldable`, similarly to Haskell,
but the author cannot think of instances of `foldable` that are not also
`Traversable`.

/-- For a list, foldl f x [y₀,y₁] reduces as follows:

```
calc  foldl f x [y₀,y₁]
    = foldl f (f x y₀) [y₁]      : rfl
... = foldl f (f (f x y₀) y₁) [] : rfl
... = f (f x y₀) y₁              : rfl
```
with
```
f : α → β → α
x : α
[y₀,y₁] : List β
```

We can view the above as a composition of functions:
```
... = f (f x y₀) y₁              : rfl
... = flip f y₁ (flip f y₀ x)    : rfl
... = (flip f y₁ ∘ flip f y₀) x  : rfl
```

We can use traverse and const to construct this composition:
```
calc   const.run (traverse (fun y ↦ const.mk' (flip f y)) [y₀,y₁]) x
     = const.run ((::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₀) <*>
         traverse (fun y ↦ const.mk' (flip f y)) [y₁]) x
...  = const.run ((::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₀) <*>
         ( (::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₁) <*> traverse (fun y ↦ const.mk' (flip f y)) [] )) x
...  = const.run ((::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₀) <*>
         ( (::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₁) <*> pure [] )) x
...  = const.run ( ((::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₁) <*> pure []) ∘
         ((::) <$> const.mk' (flip f y₀)) ) x
...  = const.run ( const.mk' (flip f y₁) ∘ const.mk' (flip f y₀) ) x
...  = const.run ( flip f y₁ ∘ flip f y₀ ) x
...  = f (f x y₀) y₁
```

And this is how `const` turns a monoid into an applicative functor and
how the monoid of endofunctions define `Foldl`.

/-- Conceptually, `toList` collects all the elements of a collection
in a list. This idea is formalized by

  `lemma toList_spec (x : t α) : toList x = foldMap FreeMonoid.mk x`.

The definition of `toList` is based on `foldl` and `List.cons` for
speed. It is faster than using `foldMap FreeMonoid.mk` because, by
using `foldl` and `List.cons`, each insertion is done in constant
time. As a consequence, `toList` performs in linear.

On the other hand, `foldMap FreeMonoid.mk` creates a singleton list
around each element and concatenates all the resulting lists. In
`xs ++ ys`, concatenation takes a time proportional to `length xs`. Since
the order in which concatenation is evaluated is unspecified, nothing
prevents each element of the traversable to be appended at the end
`xs ++ [x]` which would yield a `O(n²)` run time. -/
