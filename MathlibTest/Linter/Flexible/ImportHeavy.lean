/-! # Advanced tests for the flexible linter

This file contains tests for the flexible linter which require heavier imports, such as the
mathlib tactics `norm_num`, `ring`, `group`, `positivity` or `module`.
In essence, it verifies how certain mathlib tactics are treated.

-/

-- `norm_num` is allowed after `simp`.
#guard_msgs in
example : (0 + 2 : Rat) + 1 = 3 := by
  simp
  norm_num

warning: `simp` is a flexible tactic modifying `⊢`. Try `simp?` and use the suggested `simp only [...]`. Alternatively, use `suffices` to explicitly state the simplified form.

Note: This linter can be disabled with `set_option linter.flexible false`

-- Currently, `fun_prop` is *not* marked as flexible (as it is rather structural on the exact
