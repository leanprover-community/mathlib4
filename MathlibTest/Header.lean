warning: In the past, importing 'Lake' in mathlib has led to dramatic slow-downs of the linter (see e.g. https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13779). Please consider carefully if this import is useful and make sure to benchmark it. If this is fine, feel free to silence this linter.
note: this linter can be disabled with `set_option linter.style.header false`

warning: Files in mathlib cannot import the whole tactic folder.
note: this linter can be disabled with `set_option linter.style.header false`

warning: Files in the `Deprecated` directory are not supposed to be imported.
