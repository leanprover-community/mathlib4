error: Declaration commandAssert_not_imported_ is not allowed to be imported by this file.
It is defined in Mathlib.Util.AssertExists,
  which is imported by this file.

These invariants are maintained by `assert_not_exists` statements, and exist in order to ensure that "complicated" parts of the library are not accidentally introduced as dependencies of "simple" parts of the library.
