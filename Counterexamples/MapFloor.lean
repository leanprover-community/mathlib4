# Floors and ceils aren't preserved under ordered ring homomorphisms

Intuitively, if `f : α → β` is an ordered ring homomorphism, then floors and ceils should be
preserved by `f` because:
* `f` preserves the naturals/integers in `α` and `β` because it's a ring hom.
* `f` preserves what's between `n` and `n + 1` because it's monotone.

However, there is a catch. Potentially something whose floor was `n` could
get mapped to `n + 1`, and this has floor `n + 1`, not `n`. Note that this is at most an off by one
error.

This pathology disappears if you require `f` to be strictly monotone or `α` to be archimedean.

## The counterexample

Consider `ℤ[ε]` (`IntWithEpsilon`), the integers with infinitesimals adjoined. This is a linearly
ordered commutative floor ring (`IntWithEpsilon.linearOrderedCommRing`,
`IntWithEpsilon.floorRing`).

The map `f : ℤ[ε] → ℤ` that forgets about the epsilons (`IntWithEpsilon.forgetEpsilons`) is an
ordered ring homomorphism.

But it does not preserve floors (nor ceils) as `⌊-ε⌋ = -1` while `⌊f (-ε)⌋ = ⌊0⌋ = 0`
(`IntWithEpsilon.forgetEpsilons_floor_lt`, `IntWithEpsilon.lt_forgetEpsilons_ceil`).
