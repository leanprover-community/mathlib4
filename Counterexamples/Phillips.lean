# A counterexample on Pettis integrability

There are several theories of integration for functions taking values in Banach spaces. Bochner
integration, requiring approximation by simple functions, is the analogue of the one-dimensional
theory. It is very well behaved, but only works for functions with second-countable range.

For functions `f` taking values in a larger Banach space `B`, one can define the Dunford integral
as follows. Assume that, for all continuous linear functional `φ`, the function `φ ∘ f` is
measurable (we say that `f` is weakly measurable, or scalarly measurable) and integrable.
Then `φ ↦ ∫ φ ∘ f` is continuous (by the closed graph theorem), and therefore defines an element
of the bidual `B**`. This is the Dunford integral of `f`.

This Dunford integral is not usable in practice as it does not belong to the right space. Let us
say that a function is Pettis integrable if its Dunford integral belongs to the canonical image of
`B` in `B**`. In this case, we define the Pettis integral as the Dunford integral inside `B`.

This integral is very general, but not really usable to do analysis. This file illustrates this,
by giving an example of a function with nice properties but which is *not* Pettis-integrable.
This function:
- is defined from `[0, 1]` to a complete Banach space;
- is weakly measurable;
- has norm everywhere bounded by `1` (in particular, its norm is integrable);
- and yet it is not Pettis-integrable with respect to Lebesgue measure.

This construction is due to [Ralph S. Phillips, *Integration in a convex linear
topological space*][phillips1940], in Example 10.8. It requires the continuum hypothesis. The
example is the following.

Under the continuum hypothesis, one can find a subset of `ℝ²` which,
along each vertical line, only misses a countable set of points, while it is countable along each
horizontal line. This is due to Sierpinski, and formalized in `sierpinski_pathological_family`.
(In fact, Sierpinski proves that the existence of such a set is equivalent to the continuum
hypothesis).

Let `B` be the set of all bounded functions on `ℝ` (we are really talking about everywhere defined
functions here). Define `f : ℝ → B` by taking `f x` to be the characteristic function of the
vertical slice at position `x` of Sierpinski's set. It is our counterexample.

To show that it is weakly measurable, we should consider `φ ∘ f` where `φ` is an arbitrary
continuous linear form on `B`. There is no reasonable classification of such linear forms (they can
be very wild). But if one restricts such a linear form to characteristic functions, one gets a
finitely additive signed "measure". Such a "measure" can be decomposed into a discrete part
(supported on a countable set) and a continuous part (giving zero mass to countable sets).
For all but countably many points, `f x` will not intersect the discrete support of `φ` thanks to
the definition of the Sierpinski set. This implies that `φ ∘ f` is constant outside of a countable
set, and equal to the total mass of the continuous part of `φ` there. In particular, it is
measurable (and its integral is the total mass of the continuous part of `φ`).

Assume that `f` has a Pettis integral `g`. For all continuous linear form `φ`, then `φ g` should
be the total mass of the continuous part of `φ`. Taking for `φ` the evaluation at the point `x`
(which has no continuous part), one gets `g x = 0`. Take then for `φ` the Lebesgue integral on
`[0, 1]` (or rather an arbitrary extension of Lebesgue integration to all bounded functions,
thanks to Hahn-Banach). Then `φ g` should be the total mass of the continuous part of `φ`,
which is `1`. This contradicts the fact that `g = 0`, and concludes the proof that `f` has no
Pettis integral.

## Implementation notes

The space of all bounded functions is defined as the space of all bounded continuous functions
on a discrete copy of the original type, as mathlib only contains the space of all bounded
continuous functions (which is the useful one).

  /- The idea of the proof is to construct the desired set inductively, adding at each step a
    countable set with close to maximal measure among those points that have not already been
    chosen. Doing this countably many steps will be enough. Indeed, otherwise, a remaining set would
    have positive measure `ε`. This means that at each step the set we have added also had a large
    measure, say at least `ε / 2`. After `n` steps, the set we have constructed has therefore
    measure at least `n * ε / 2`. This is a contradiction since the measures have to remain
    uniformly bounded.

    We argue from the start by contradiction, as this means that our inductive construction will
    never be stuck, so we won't have to consider this case separately.

    In this proof, we use explicit coercions `↑s` for `s : A` as otherwise the system tries to find
    a `CoeFun` instance on `↥A`, which is too costly.

### A set in `ℝ²` large along verticals, small along horizontals

We construct a subset of `ℝ²`, given as a family of sets, which is large along verticals (i.e.,
it only misses a countable set along each vertical) but small along horizontals (it is countable
along horizontals). Such a set can not be measurable as it would contradict Fubini theorem.
We need the continuum hypothesis to construct it.

### A counterexample for the Pettis integral

We construct a function `f` from `[0,1]` to a complete Banach space `B`, which is weakly measurable
(i.e., for any continuous linear form `φ` on `B` the function `φ ∘ f` is measurable), bounded in
norm (i.e., for all `x`, one has `‖f x‖ ≤ 1`), and still `f` has no Pettis integral.

This construction, due to Phillips, requires the continuum hypothesis. We will take for `B` the
space of all bounded functions on `ℝ`, with the supremum norm (no measure here, we are really
talking of everywhere defined functions). And `f x` will be the characteristic function of a set
which is large (it has countable complement), as in the Sierpinski pathological family.
