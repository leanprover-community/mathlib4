An example of a `LinearOrderedCommMonoidWithZero` in which the product of two positive
elements vanishes.

This is the monoid with 3 elements `0, ε, 1` where `ε ^ 2 = 0` and everything else is forced.
The order is `0 < ε < 1`.  Since `ε ^ 2 = 0`, the product of strictly positive elements can vanish.
