# `Monic` does not necessarily imply `IsRegular` in a `Semiring` with no opposites

This counterexample shows that the hypothesis `Ring R` cannot be changed to `Semiring R` in
`Polynomial.Monic.isRegular`.

The example is very simple.

The coefficient Semiring is the Semiring `N₃` of the natural numbers `{0, 1, 2, 3}` where the
standard addition and standard multiplication are truncated at `3`.

The products `(X + 2) * (X + 2)` and `(X + 2) * (X + 3)` are equal to
`X ^ 2 + 4 * X + 4` and `X ^ 2 + 5 * X + 6` respectively.

By truncation, `4, 5, 6` all mean `3` in `N`.
It follows that multiplication by `(X + 2)` is not injective.
