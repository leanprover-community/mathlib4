# Irrational power of irrational numbers are not necessarily irrational.

Prove that there exist irrational numbers `a`, `b` such that `a^b` is rational.

We use the following famous argument (based on the law of excluded middle and irrationality of √2).
Consider `c = √2^√2`. If `c` is rational, we are done.
If `c` is irrational, then `c^√2 = 2` is rational, so we are done.

There exist irrational `a`, `b` with rational `a^b`.
Note that the positivity assumption on `a` is imposed because of the definition of `rpow` for
negative bases. See `Real.rpow_def_of_neg` for more details.
