/-! # `CharP R 0` and `CharZero R` need not coincide for semirings

For rings, the two notions coincide.

In fact, `CharP.ofCharZero` shows that `CharZero R` implies `CharP R 0` for any `CharZero`
`AddMonoid R` with `1`.
The reverse implication holds for any `AddLeftCancelMonoid R` with `1`, by `charP_to_charZero`.

This file shows that there are semirings `R` for which `CharP R 0` holds and `CharZero R` does not.

The example is `{0, 1}` with saturating addition.
