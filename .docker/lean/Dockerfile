# This is the Dockerfile for `leanprovercommunity/lean4`.
# It is based on the generic `debian` image, and installs `elan` and the current stable version of `lean`.

# This container does not come with a pre-installed version of mathlib;
# you should call `lake exe cache get` which will download the most recent version.
# The only difference between this Dockerfile and leanprovercommunity/lean4 is that this image
# bypasses a warning that could occur when trying to connect to github for the first time.

# NOTE: to run this docker image on macos or windows,
# you will need to increase the allowed memory (in the docker GUI) beyond 2GB
