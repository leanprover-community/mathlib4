# Usage: ./lake-build-with-retry.sh <target_name> [max_tries, default: 5]
#
# In the build workflows generated by .github/build.in.yml,
# this script MUST be run after cd-ing into pr-branch/,
# since we tell lake-build-wrapper.py to save a file to .lake/
# relative to the current working directory,
# as only that path is writable in our landrun sandbox.

# Make this script robust against unintentional errors.
# See e.g. http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/ for explanation.
