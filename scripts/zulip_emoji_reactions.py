# this takes rather different values:
# - if a PR is closed/reopened, it is 'closed' resp. 'reopened' (though the particular value for
#   reopening is not used in this script)
# - if a PR was just merged by bors, it is '[Merged by Bors]'
# - if a PR was labeled or unlabeled (with e.g. maintainer-merge or awaiting-review),
#   it is 'labeled' resp. 'unlabeled' (and the next argument is the label name)
# - if a PR was delegated or sent to bors (via a bors r+, bors merge, bors delegate or bors d+
#   command), it is 'ready-to-merge' or 'delegated'. On a bors merge-, bors r- or bors d- command,
#   it is 'remove-label'. (This particular value is not used in this script.)
#   Note that `bors d-` is *not* a bors command, so only has an effect on mathlib's PR labels.
