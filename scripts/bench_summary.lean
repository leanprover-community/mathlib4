/-- `Bench` is a structure with the data used to compute the `!bench` summary.
It contains
* a string `file` (that could be `build`, `lint` or `~Mathlib.Path.To.File`);
* an integer `diff` representing the change in number of instructions for `file`;
* a float `reldiff` representing the percentage change in number of instructions for `file`.

/-- `intDecs z exp prec` is a "generic" formatting of an integer `z`.
It writes `z` in the form `x.y * 10 ^ exp` (for non-negative integers `x`, `y` and `z`),
such that `y` has `prec` digits and returns
* the sign of `z` as a string (in fact, just either `+` or `-`);
* the integer `x`;
* the natural number `y` (that has `prec` digits).

  let z := sgn * z

  let idec := z / p10
  (if sgn < 0 then "-" else "+", idec / (10 ^ prec), (idec % 10 ^ prec).toNat)

`toTable bcs` formats an array of `Bench`es into a markdown table whose columns are
the file name, the absolute change in instruction counts and the relative change as a percentage.
A typical entry may look like ``|`Mathlib.Analysis.Seminorm`|+2.509⬝10⁹|(+1.41%)|``.

`toCollapsibleTable bcs roundDiff` is similar to `toTable bcs`, except that it returns
output enclosed in a `<details><summary>` html-block.
The `<summary>` part tallies the number of entries in `bcs` whose instructions increased
resp. decreased by at least the amount `roundDiff`.

/-- `addBenchSummaryComment PR repo tempFile` adds a summary of benchmarking results
as a comment to a pull request.  It takes as input
* the number `PR` and the name `repo` as a `String` containing the relevant pull-request
  (it reads and posts comments there)
* the optional `jobID` string for reporting the action that produced the output
* the `String` `tempFile` of a temporary file where the command stores transient information.

The code itself interfaces with the shell to retrieve and process json data and eventually
uses `benchOutput`.
Here is a summary of the steps:
* retrieve the last comment to the PR (using `gh pr view ...`),
* check if it was posted by `leanprover-bot`,
* try to retrieve the source and target commits from the url that the bot posts
  and store them in `source` and `target`,
* query the speed center for the benchmarking data (using `curl url`),
* format and filter the returned JSON data (various times),
  saving intermediate steps into `tempFile` (using `jq` multiple times),
* process the final string to produce a summary (using `benchOutput`),
* finally post the resulting output to the PR (using `gh pr comment ...`).
