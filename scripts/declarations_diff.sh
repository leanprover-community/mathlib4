#  The `declarations_diff` script

The `declarations_diff` script is a text-based script that attempts to find which declarations
have been removed and which declarations have been added in the current PR with respect to `master`.

In essence, it looks at the output of `git diff origin/master...HEAD`, extracts the lines that
contain one of the keywords

`theorem` `lemma` `inductive` `structure` `def` `class` `instance` `alias`

and tries to find exact matches between a removed line and an added line
(e.g. when moving a declaration from one file to another or restructuring within the same file).

Exact matches are removed.
Among the remaining unmatched lines, the script tries to extract the declaration ids and tries to
find exact matches among those.
No effort is made to keep track of namespaces: if the declaration is `theorem abc ...`, then
`abc` is extracted, even if this happens inside `namespace xyz`.
If a declaration id is added exactly once *and* removed exactly once,
then they are again considered paired and are not shown.

If a declaration id is either only added or removed or it is added or removed more than once, then
the script will return a count such as

++--+ thmName

This means that a declaration `thmName` was added 3 times and removed twice: this can happen
with namespacing, e.g. you could see it with `++-- map_zero`.

The script uses some heuristics to guide this process.
* It assumes that each keyword (as above) appears on the same line as the corresponding
  declaration id --- a line break between `theorem` and `riemannHypothesis` fools the script.
* It deals with declaration modifiers (such as `noncomputable`, `nonrec`, `protected`) and
  attributes.
* It is "aware" of "nameless" `instance`s and, rather than looking for a declaration id,
  in this case records the whole line `instance ...`.
