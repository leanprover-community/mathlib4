-- Manual exceptions for the text-based linters.
-- This file is to `style-exceptions.txt` what `nolints.json` is to `@nolint` attributes:
-- The latter is supposed to become and stay mostly empty over time (though files longer than
-- 1500 lines can be transient exceptions for some longer time period),
-- the former could be necessary in the long term.
-- In this case, it's a side-effect of making the linter stricter than its Python ancestor.

-- This file was recognised as import-only by the old heuristic, but not by the new, simpler one.

-- The linter for the string "adaptation note" fires in the implementation of the linter,
-- and in the implementation of the #adaptation_note tactic: this is as expected.
