"""
This file reads in the four yaml files, and translates them to simpler json files
that are easier to process in Lean.

Usage:
  python3 yaml_check.py <100.yaml> <1000.yaml> <overview.yaml> <undergrad.yaml>

(Each <name> is the path to a yaml file containing information about the respective class
 of theorems. The order of these files is important.)
